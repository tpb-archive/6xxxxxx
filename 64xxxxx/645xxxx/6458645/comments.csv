What are the risks?"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-06-11T02:29Z,"INSTALLATION: image's Autorun installs game fine, u having probs are jus dumb or somethin. like kumzoo75
STEAM: this install doesn't use or access steam so there should be no conflict with your steam account.
SAVING: game saves at autosave points until you get to player save points later where you can create save files.
KEY MAPPING: if anyone finds a way to customize controls please let us know. the preset bindings are a pretty stupid design."

Nothing works even after the autorun of steambackup which did a lot but yielded no start menu shortcut or desktop shortcut (no new folders where I specified) So where did it put all those files?

,Rawlings44,2011-06-11T09:51Z,Good torrent but the developers obviously didn't test their audio. Right now it sounds like static and it stutters even though the game runs fine. I'm pretty sure it's the developer's fault and not the torrent itself.

This game SUCKS in terms of default PC keymapping.

There appears to be no way to re-map yet, is that right?

The original Dungeon Siege and LOA had some great key-combos, like one that picked up all the Loot in one shot.

Is there any such command here?  Or do you have to walk over each and every coin cluster to collect them?

Thank you again - sincerely."
,Enmiand,2011-06-12T02:58Z,"Guys, I did everything as said for Windows 7 and it worked wonders, BUT, there is one BIG issue that hasn't been addressed properly so far.
If you, by some random chance, DONT run the steambackup.exe in Admin mode, it will create a folder you cannot see nor access in any possible way.

I did it 2 times just to be sure it wasn't some sort of mistake from my part and now I've got 2 Dungeon Siege 3 folders using space on my hard drive wich I cannot seem to delete. 

I re installed the game for a third time, now in admin mode and it went perfect, creating a folder I can see for a change.

Anyone knows why does this happen on Windows 7 and how in God's name I can delete those 2 folders I will not be using in the near future?

Random fact: When I run the installer in normal mode (not admin) I CAN see the folders created previously, but I cannot access them nevertheless. When I run the installer in admin mode, the folders just vanish.
Ideas? I really would want my 5 GB's back.

,swift77,2011-06-12T09:21Z,The controls are worse than bad and most of the time when fighting bosses you have no clue where you running. Game is linear and picking up loot gets boring. Explanation and design of DPS copmbat vs DPS ability is made by an idiot. The tactic/strategic playstyle is crap due to the small visual game area at any given time and add the poor control of movement and the game gets a big FAIL from me. 
,MisterDB,2011-06-12T09:51Z,"I was SUCH a huge fan of DS 1 - you could save anywhere you wanted to, you had the ability to have different group formations, the zoom was not just a toggle - you could zoom in and out nicely, and moving was much more fluid with the mouse.

DS 2 lost the ability to save anywhere, and this game lacks it too.

And it is SO lame to control it is driving me crazy!  ARGH!

I'm VERY grateful for the torrent and really appreciate you providing it.  It's going to save me $40 cause unless things get better fast, I'm going to delete it and not purchase the full game.

Man, I was looking forward to this one too!

I guess Diablo III is the next one to keep an eye out for.  I hope it rocks."

""Run As Administrator"" SteamBackup.exe...."
,Enmiand,2011-06-13T19:58Z,"@MisterDB

I first installed the game by creating a folder on my C:/Program files one, named Dungeon Siege 3. Then, when I went to check on it, it wasn't there.

I tought I did something wrong, so I re installed it, again on C:/Program Files but this time I let the game create its own folder named Dungeon Siege III. Went to check, nothing.

At that time I realized I had something like 5 GB's of space being used by two installed DS3 folders I could not see. 

I ran the installer once again and, to my surprise, only when doing THAT I could see the damn folders, but I couldn't delete them nor manipulate them in any way.

Strange thing is, when I ran the installer in admin mode, I couldn't see the folders, not even from the installer itself. Ran it again on normal mode and then they appeared again.

So, short story: the damn folders exist, they're using my space, but the only way I have to see them is from a installer that does not allow me to manipulate them.

If anyone has any idea on how to delete these damn things I would really appreciate it.
Also, controls suck and there is no camera control whatsoever. I feel like playing Castlevania on N64."

I confirm this is the good way to install the game. the third time I installed it I did it as admin ad it installed with no problems and no invisible folders whatsoever.

Still, Im unable to locate the two ghost folders I have currently takin up my space in C. I have a theory though. If I re install the game as admin again and put in the same names on the invisible folders, would it replace the old files with the new visible ones so I can delete them or will it create new ones despite the fact that it is installed in the exact same location?

As it is, I'm too afraid to keep installing this and it draining my space :C"

I re installed the game for a 4th time as admin and in the exact same location  where I know the invisible folders are.

The game installed correctly, so I can see it. Then I went ahead and deleted it all. Even so, the invisble folders keep using my space. I checked with the installer in non-admin mode and there they are, as vivid as ever, so, short story: you cannot overwrite the files in the invisible folders with files installed correctly via admin mode.

Still looking for an answer :("
,Kamianbu,2011-06-14T22:47Z,"@gokke123

I have played both. You still have freedom of a sorts with this game, it's just lacks the sense of freedom to it.
As for the ""Bound"" characters, eh, it's a pain in the ass, but A LOT of games have bound characters where you can't change their appearance. Not surprising.

While alot of it is more or less them going backwards, the game itself is still good. then again I'm not a teenager who lives on shooting people in high graphics. I'm the type who enjoys a good plot and a decent game despite it's flaws.

To those who have hidden folders... go to control panel - folder options - view - click to view hidden files and folders then delete them or whatever."

SOLUTION TO THE GHOST FOLDER PROBLEM:

,newbie223,2011-06-29T00:25Z,"To make offline coop work with 2 controllers
Do the following:
DL: XBOX 360 emu http://www.tocaedit.com/IB/index.php?automodule=downloads&showfile=4

You must have 2 controllers with joystick analogs, PS2, XBOX360, Logitech 

Unzip the file to your DS3 Folder, then open the file xbox360cemu

Copy and paste PAD1 details (Key bindings) onto PAD2, below the ""INDEX="" line,  

Set PAD2 INDEX= 1 

Test Controller 2 by using the application XinputTest that comes with the file

Make sure the start button is activated on the 2nd Pad

Start the game and enable Gamepad support on the options menu

Go through the character select screen, and let player 1 skip all the cutscenes to in-game

Get player 2 to press start, select a character on the pop up menu, you cannot select the same character P1 is using.

And you get the second player in the game without using another computer.

Specified Keybindings between your controller and the XBOX 360 emu is a bit technical.

Thanks to RELOADED and the makers of the XBOX 360 controller emu project"
,newbie223,2011-06-29T00:34Z,"For people, who don't have XBOX360 wireless controllers or supported PC controllers like me

look for the XBOX 360 controller emulation program.  Unzip it to where the .exe file is in your pc hard drive and then it'll work on ANY controller with an Analog Stick e.g. PS2/1 Layout.  I tested this with a USB generic PS2 pad and it WORKS!

,Xarlequin,2011-07-04T01:16Z,"Many people mentioned the game starting properly, but not being able to see the menus and so.

This means you are missing a component on your computer. In the installation folder you will find a folder called redist. Inside you will find a exe file called ""vcredist_x86"" and a folder called DirectX. Use the ""vcredist_x86"" file, and then use DXSETUP inside the DirectX folder.

Atleast this solved the issue for me. I am not sure which program I was missing, and therefore installed both and included them in this post."
,whoislegend,2011-07-04T02:51Z,"For those of you having the problem not seeing the game folder after installation.

,chip211,2011-08-07T07:15Z,in my opinion they have DESTROYED the whole franchise with this game
,Banzay27,2011-08-08T01:55Z,"So far, so good. No hitches downloading or installing. The game's not a hardware hog, my PC can run it on high settings without any lag, I'm satisfied on that point. Art style is also reasonably satisfactory.
This is no triple A title as is evident in dialogs, overall story and lack of cinematic cutscenes. But hey, I'm enjoying it better than first Dungeon Siege, and I played it back in its day.
I don't know how this has changed compared to Dungeon Siege, which I didn't play, but compared to the first, I'm pleased with the changes.

Both combat and dialog are fluid, even if the latter needs the camera switching to face our character when he or she speaks, if not also better scripting, but then, I haven't played halfway yet.
Voice acting could be better. The ones for the available characters being most pertinent, I only minimally respect 2 of the works, the voicing of the knight (which does a good job of diluting his all-too-asian look) and of the gipsy gunslinger, which sounds rather attractively exotic, in that original gipsy russian accent. If that matters to you at least as much, leave the other 2 aside for starters, their voicing is insipid and weak.

But back to the bottom line, while this is no blockbuster, it certainly can be fun, albeit boring if you're one to delve into the lore as much as is allowed us (reading scrolls and book passages is tedious, somehow, wonder if that was just chance). Again, though, much better experience than what I remember from the first, which was one of the Diablo clones so trendy at that time, being a hack & slash dungeon crawl with an all-too large party of companions who were barely interactive and whom you had to micromanage to make proper use of.
Hm... it's been a while. I don't know for sure. Just know I didn't enjoy it well and quit, which I rarely do. This one's going a different way."

,shipz2640,2011-09-25T05:21Z,@stifler12 Thanks. The uploader has the complete wrong instructions for installing this game and mentions nothing about having to run this file to install the actual game.
,DFAx1,2011-09-25T18:20Z,"************************************************************************************

SOME NOOB DEVELOPER FUCKED UP AND WROTE IN THE SETUP.INI THAT THE GAME REQUIRES 40GB TO INSTALL INSTEAD OF 4GB (AS INTENDED)

IS IT REALLY WORTH PLAYING AN UNPOLISHED/UNTESTED GAME?

THIS IS WHY I LIKE BLIZZARD GAMES, THEY HAVE A BETA PHASE, I THINK THIS GAME WAS RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE JUST TO GET MONEY.

LOL AT CRACKING THIS PEICE OF SHIT, NO MONEY FOR THESE FUCKS"
,SpyNT,2011-10-14T02:58Z,"This installed fine (be sure to use ""steambackup.exe"").

HOWEVER, I stopped playing after 15 minutes and uninstalled. I was ready to overlook the blandness of the game until I realised how crappy the default control is. And what do you know, there's no way to change the controls. Another case of consolite breaking a video game series. HELLO, I'm a PC gamer.

Thank the heavens for torrents. You are not getting my money, Obsidian.

Has anybody else had this problem ?
I will try to download it while my antivirus is off, but i don't think that's the problem, because my antivirus would inform me if there was a virus, and there is no way i could've interrupted it, because it was downloading while i was sleeping...
Please tell me if you have a solution for this !!!"
