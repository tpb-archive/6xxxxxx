The MV Wilhelm Gustloff was a German KdF flagship during 1937-1945, constructed by the Blohm & Voss shipyards. It sank after being torpedoed by the Soviet submarine S-13 on 30 January 1945.

The ship was named after Wilhelm Gustloff, the assassinated German leader of the Swiss Nazi party. It was requisitioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) on 1 September 1939 and served as a hospital ship during 1939 and 1940. Beginning on 20 November 1940, it was stripped of medical equipment and repainted from its hospital ship colors (white with a green stripe) to standard naval grey. The Wilhelm Gustloff was then assigned as a floating barracks for naval personnel in Nazi occupied Poland in the port of Gdynia (renamed during German occupation to Gotenhafen), near Danzig (now GdaÅ„sk in Poland), from 1940 onwards.

The Wilhelm Gustloff\'s final voyage was during Operation Hannibal in January 1945, when it was sunk while participating in the evacuation of military personnel, Nazi officials and civilians who were surrounded by the Red Army in East Prussia. The Gustloff was hit by three torpedoes from the Soviet submarine S-13 in the Baltic Sea on the night of 30 January 1945 and sank in less than 45 minutes. An estimated 9,400 people were killed in the sinking. If accurate, this would be the largest known loss of life occurring during a single ship sinking in recorded maritime history.

Now, NGC examines the events leading up to the catastrophe and looks for answers to the mystery surrounding the fateful night.
