With his chameleon-like ability to inhabit a variety of outlandish characters and keen comic timing, funnyman Jamie Kennedy has kept the laughs coming for years by successfully navigating between television and film. In this release Kennedy proves that the laughs aren't simply limited to the screen by stepping onto the stage of the San Jose Theater for his first-ever stand-up special. In addition to covering the gamut of subjects from family life to cat sex, the comic also offers all the outlandish characters and impressions that fans have come to know and love.
