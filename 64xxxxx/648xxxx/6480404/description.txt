Cave in the Snow (2002)
This documentary is based on Vicky MacKenzieâ€™s book Cave in the Snow, and features Diane Perry, born in 1946 in England. Ever since she was a child, she wanted to find truth. At 21, she became a Buddhist nun in India, where she was given the name Tenzin Palmo. She lived for 12 years in a cave high up in the Himalayas, in a lonely retreat. In the film she clearly explains the importance of such retreats. She is now working to establish a monastery for nuns in India, where the nuns will be able to receive the highest education, which for cultural reasons has only been available to men in many Buddhist traditions. She has the full support of her teacher Khamtrul Rinpoche and HH the Dalai Lama in this work. In order to make her mission a reality, this woman who has spent so many years alone in retreat, is travelling around the world to raise funds for the monastery and to teach thousands of followers and other interested people.
