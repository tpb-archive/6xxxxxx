Here you have another one of my big, messy libraries of Buddhist texts, this one full of texts related to Theravada Buddhism, the oldest existing Buddhist tradition. Like the rest of what is becoming a series, these were on an old hard drive. I realized that I could get them up and out more quickly if I just upload them as they are.

These libraries are like boxes of dusty old documents, unsorted except by the general topic, Theravada Buddhism in this case. Help yourself!

Formats include .txt, .doc, .rft, .pdf, and .html - nothing in .epub or .mobi. The texts are in English. I suspect that most of these come from the amazing free online libraries of Buddhanet.net, but I am not sure.

May all beings be happy, and may all beings who download this torrent help to seed it. Feel free to clean up this collection, change the formats, or do anything you can to share it.

I have also uploaded libraries of Tibetan Buddhist, Zen Buddhist, and Pureland Buddhist texts. Please check my other torrents for other Buddhist texts.

Also, I made a mistake and posted my Tibetan Buddhism - 350 texts torrent as anonymous.  You can find it at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6479345/Tibetan_Buddhism_-_350_texts
