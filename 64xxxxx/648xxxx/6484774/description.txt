ZPAY TimeClockWindow 1.0.54

The TimeClockWindow application follows a long line of easy to use payroll tools starting with ZPAY, ZPAY 3, then PayWindow and now TimeClockWindow. The best news is that our time clock is network ready and can be installed on all of your workstations and used by all of your employees in the same office. No extra costs for workstations or for the number of employees in the company, no limits!No more managing hours by hand! No more spending half a day trying to add up the employee time and pulling your hair out because of messy employee cards that you can't decipher! Automation with our time clock software is the answer!The best thing about TimeClockWindow is that it has full integration with PayWindow.

That means full importing employee, company and departments data from PayWindow and pushing the employee hours direct into PayWindow each payday! Starting with the time clock employee interface, as you can see below, it shows you exactly who is clocked in and who is clocked out with color coded tags on the employee \"time cards\". Red is out, green is in and blue is on break or lunch. There is even a mailbox that shows when the employee has a message waiting when the flag is up. The administrator interface of TimeClockWindow gives you all the tools and power you need to set up and manage your employee time records. And for PayWindow users, it\'s as easy as clicking a few buttons to import your employees from PayWindow! And if you update any employees in PayWindow, simply re-import to refresh the data.The Employee forgets to clock out? You can edit the \"time transactions\" to easily fix problems like that. You can even add transactions such as Holiday hours if you have paid holidays, sick time if you pay sick time and even vacation hours.

A few Comments from our exit survey that the beta testers took:

Did TimeClockWindow make time tracking easier for you?: Yes. My staff is especially crazy about the greater accuracy and ease of it. The possibility of an employee clocking someone in or out is all but eliminated by computer access security whereas if someone has a time card, they can clock the owner in or out regardless of where the owner actually may be.

Attractive to the greatest number of people: Word of mouth is always the best. I'm always happy to share with other what's working for me and not. It helps that your product is not outrageously expensive. I've searched the internet looking for programs and yours was the easiest and you've been very prompt in answering queries. I appreciate that.

Did you find the Employee Interface easy to use?: YES all my workers figured it out on their own.

Did TimeClockWindow make time tracking easier for you?: Of course it did! it can't get much easier than point and click! No more using an adding machine so I can manually input the values into payroll.

Did TimeClockWindow make time tracking easier for you?: Yes. Before TimeClockWindow I was tracking employee's time manually. At times I would forget to document when an employee reported to work and when the left, thus causing an occasional dispute over actual time worked. This moved the tracking of employee's time from me to the employees. This also eliminated any controversy over when an employee clocked-in and clocked-out.

How does TimeClockWindow compare to other time clocks?: We use an Acroprint time station with a magnetic card that the employee swipes. Cards are lost or damaged. If that occurs, I cannot just issue another card; it has to be a card with the SAME employee number since I can't change employee number in ZPAY in mid year. The replacement cards are expensive, with a delivered cost of about $5.00 to replace a specific card number. The alternative is to buy 50 cards for $150.00.

Had to say all that to say this - as long as the computer works, I have a time station. Exporting data to ZPAY is more bullet proof than the ASCII export/import function for the Acro station that ZPAY graciously provides.
