Physxtech is our unique math algorithm cleverly included in every DVD-Ranger core. With our Physxtech technology, DVD-Ranger produces an unbeaten playback quality of your recompressed video. The advantage of Physxtech is that the source will be recompressed faster and more efficient than our competitorâ€™s old-fashioned methods. Physxtech relies on a state-of-the-art interpolation algorithm that models moves with extremely accurate calculations. The quality of the copied DVD will increase tremendously, unlike common calculations featured by classic copying software, which are based on unstable fixed tables. The power of Physxtech is undeniable, considering the fact that downsides like block artifacts are reduced and corrected while at the same time action-loaded and bit-hungry scenes are recompressed properly and produced more efficiently.
