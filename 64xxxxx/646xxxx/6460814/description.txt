The film opens with the bombing of a US Army Barracks in Saudi Arabia (using real-life news footage from the Khobar Towers bombing) leading to both civilian and military American casualties. The U.S. blames a group led by a certain "Sheikh  Ahmed bin Talal" who is subsequently seized and surgically extracted before being held under the watch of Major General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis).
----------------------------
FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an apparent explosive device. The bomb turns out merely to be a huge paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives warnings to release Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal.Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA officer Elise Kraft (Annette Benning). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and a bus is bombed. When the FBI captures a man named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. Kraft is both romantically involved with Samir and his handler.
---------------------------------------------

The terrorist incidents begin to escalate. A crowded theater is bombed, a kindergarten is held hostage and the FBI headquarters is destroyed with over 600 casualties.
--------------------------------------------
In spite of objections the President declares martial law and the Army's 101st Airborne Division, under Devereaux, occupies and seals off Brooklyn in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently all young males of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr, are rounded up and detained in a makeshift prison camp in Yankee Stadium. Haddad resigns in 
anger. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the army and the racial profiling of the Arabs and the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings.

Hubbard and Kraft, now going by the name Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini. Devereaux tortures and kills Husseini in the course of the interrogation. After this Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini knew nothing of value because of the basic principles of compartmentalized information and, sickened, she finally tells Hubbard 

what she knows. It is revealed that she herself provided training and support to certain militants opposed to SaddamHussein's regime. After the funding and support was suddenly cut, due to a policy shift by the American government, Bridger 
took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by pro-Hussein forces arranging for them to be able to escape to the United States and ultimately leading to the present situation. She and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with 
the final terrorist cell. Hubbard convinces Haddad that he needs his help and Haddad returns to the FBI.
----------------------------------------------

A peaceful march involving all ethnic groups in New York demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he himself constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, "there will never be a last cell." He 
straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate amongst the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to stop himleaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the stomach as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard kills Samir but despite their best efforts he and Haddad can only watch as Bridger bleeds to death.
--------------------------------------------

Hubbard, accompanied by other FBI agents places Major. Gen. Devereaux under arrest for the torture and murder of Tariq Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the War Powers Resolution the authority vested in him by the President now supersedes that of the court which issued the arrest warrant and he declares himself to be the law. He then commands his soldiers to aim their guns at the FBI agents resulting in a Mexican standoff. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all his predecessors have fought and died for. Devereaux finally submits to arrest. Martial law ends and the detainees are freed, including Haddad's son.
