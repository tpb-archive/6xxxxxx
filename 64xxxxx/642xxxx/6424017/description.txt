In war everyone loses. This brutal truth can be seen in the eyes of every soldier in every worldâ€¦

In Letherii, the exiled Malazan army commanded by Adjunct Tavore begins its march into the eastern Wastelands, to fight for an unknown cause against an enemy it has never seen.

And in these same Wastelands, others gather to confront their destinies. The warlike Barghast, thwarted in their vengeance against the Tiste Edur, seek new enemies beyond the border and Onos Toolan, once immortal Tâ€™lan Imass now mortal commander of the White Face clan, faces insurrection. To the south, the Perish Grey Helms parlay passage through the treacherous kingdom of Bolkando. Their intention is to rendezvous with the Bonehunters but their vow of allegiance to the Malazans will be sorely tested. And ancient enclaves of an Elder Race are in search of salvationâ€”not among their own kind, but among humansâ€”as an old enemy draws ever closer to the last surviving bastion of the Kâ€™Chain Cheâ€™Malle.

So this last great army of the Malazan Empire is resolved to make one final defiant, heroic stand in the name of redemption. But can deeds be heroic when there is no one to witness them? And can that which is not witnessed forever change the world? Destines are rarely simple, truths never clear but one certainty is that time is on no oneâ€™s side. For the Deck of Dragons has been read, unleashing a dread power that none can comprehendâ€¦

In a faraway land and beneath indifferent skies, the final chapter of â€˜The Malazan Book of the Fallenâ€™ has begunâ€¦
