The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

Part Three

     I know these are coming fast but don\'t worry. They should be seeded for many months to come. You will have time to get them if the history of the original MTCDC is any guideline.

What\'s This?
     It\'s a project to upload everything that\'s been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That\'s DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America\'s Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those \"Pre-DC\" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn\'t know started with a different company. There will some \"Post DC\" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It\'s going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I\'ve already done a 600+gb subset of this. Here we go again, but bigger.

This Third installment is: Adventure Comics

Due to the size of Adventure Comics (All volumes) it needs its own torrent. 

Now we must go back over 75 years......

     It was the fall of 1935 and the Great Depression was over the land. In Germany, Italy and Japan, imperial designs were stirring. Pulp fiction wasn\'t a movie - it was thrilling stories - in magazines with lurid covers. Science fiction was rapidly assuming it\'s shape and approaching it\'s golden age. 

Before Action... Before Detective... Before Super Heroes... 
there was Adventure!.

     It was called \"New Comics\" at the start, I believe because comic books of the time were often reprints of the newspaper strips, but these were first run. Starting with issue 12 (01-1937) it was \"New Adventure Comics\". Those early issues were a mix of humor and adventure stories. Super heroes did not yet exist. Cowboys, detectives and adventurers held sway. But in Gotham city and Smallville, Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent were growing up...

     June 1938 New Adventure Comics #27 carries such features as \"Detective Sgt. Carey of the Chinatown Squad\" and \"Federal Men\", but it also carried an ad for Action #1 with a guy named Superman on the cover. A year later \"Adventure Comics\" (renamed at #32) had it\'s own super hero cover â€” The Sandman â€” who would be around till #102. Other super-heroes such as Starman, Hour Man, Manhunter and Shining Knight soon joined him. But then that guy from Action took over (as a boy), but still sharing with Aquaman, Green Arrow, Johnny Quick and more. Adventure became home eventually to the Legion of Superheroes, but that was not the last change Supergirl moves out of the back of Action in June 1969, just before the first Moon landing. Supergirl was gone after #424 in (10-1972). Supergirl v1 #1 was dated 11-1972. Later issues of Adventure featured a lot of reprints, but had such notable features as Dial H for Hero and the Spectre.

Today\'s offering: Adventure Comics

     A number of the early issues are from microfiche and not paper scans. Readability is controversial. I am able to read the worst of them, others declare them worthless and don\'t even include them in torrents. I give you these and the reprints, trying to do the best I can.

Adventure Comics 80 Page Giant 001 (10-1998 )
Adventure Comics Special-The Guardian 001 (2009)
Adventure Comics v1 032-503 after New Adventure Comics 31 (1938-1983)
Adventure Comics v1 alternate scans (7 misc)
Adventure Comics v1 Reprints (78)
     These are provided because many scans of early issues are fiche, of poor originals, or both (no criticism of the scanner, they do their best with what they have to work with) These scans of reprints are clear and easy to read. Fiche is nearly always dark, sometimes very dark. and frequently somewhat blurry. (but not always).

Adventure Comics v2 001 ctc (1999) One shot.
Adventure Comics v3 so far. 000, 504-526 (2009-2011)
     Two whole issue reprints.
Millennium Edition 047-Adventure Comics 247
Millennium Edition 052-Adventure Comics 061
     These last two items should be in the Ns but some people won\'t get that and I want the whole set together even though the name changed twice. They will be repeated in the N\'s for the sake of those who look there for them.
New Comics 01-11 becomes New Adventure 12 (1935-36) 
New Adventure Comics 12-31 becomes Adventure 32 (1937-38 )

List of Reprints Scan Included as alternates
     Of course many of these are reprints of later stories from issues with great scans, but I\'m not going to pick and choose. It\'s my way.
