Duma Key - Stephen King-viny

After a construction accident in which he loses his right arm and his divorce, Edgar Freemantle moves from Minnesota to Florida to begin what his psychiatrist described as a "geographic cure."  He rediscovers his love of painting and finds that he is good at it but his paintings seem to have something "more" to them.  On Duma Key he also finds a new friendship with Wireman, a kindred spirit seeking refuge there as a caretaker for Elizabeth Eastlake.  Elizabeth's past also contains painful memories that have been reawakened bringing all of them together to face an evil entity named Perse.
