Cell - Stephen King-viny

Artist Clayton Riddell had been in Boston negotiating a successful deal to sell his comic book project.  His joy at finally hitting it big is shattered by an event called The Pulse which causes all those who were using their cell phones at the time of The Pulse to become zombies attacking and killing anyone in their way.  Fortunately for Clay, he does not own a cell phone.  In the panic to get out of Boston and find his way home to his wife and son in Maine, he is joined by Tom McCourt, a man he meets in the meleÃ© immediately following The Pulse and a young girl, Alice, who they rescue from being killed by one of the â€œcrazies.â€  The story follows their terrifying journey, avoiding captureâ€”and worseâ€”by the â€œcraziesâ€ who are beginning to â€œflockâ€ and are led by one they call Raggedy Man as they attempt to reach Maine and a place called Kashwak which they hope will be their salvation.
