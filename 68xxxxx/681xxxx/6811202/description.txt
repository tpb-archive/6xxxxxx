Africa on the Move
AFRICA ON THE MOVE captures the vibrancy of Africa's diverse people and rich cultures, and introduces us to men and women who embody the amazing changes occurring on a daily basis across 53 countries.
The four part series offers a dramatically different view of the continent. Instead of the catastrophic scenarios presented so often in the world's media, the films follow stories of struggle, perseverance, creativity and inspiring achievement. Shot in northern, western, southern and central Africa, the stories focus on larger-than-life individuals whose quest to bring about dramatic change in their worlds introduces us to an extraordinary array of artists, activists, students, businesspeople, and regular citizens, all vigorously striving for better lives. The series also features spectacular footage of the African continent, from its vast desert landscapes and dense tropical forests, to its breathtaking mountain country and striking urban skyscrapers. AFRICA ON THE MOVE offers a timely window onto a continent that is challenging our perceptions and changing the world.


1)  A Dream of Millions 
When the tyranny of apartheid officially ended in South Africa in 1991, few predicted what might happen to the country's economy. But now, with its population of nearly 50 million, its dynamic energy and its vast treasure of natural resources, it has the most powerful economy on the continent and attracts eager investors from around the globe. And who are the money players in this new "beloved country?" In the beating heart of South Africa, in Soweto, we meet a woman who began life sleeping with six siblings on one blanket, selling corn to black commuters. Today, Nancy Nxumalo is a force of nature. She's one of the most influential businesspeople in this vigorous, storied township. A one-time fearless activist now turned mogul, she revels in the tectonic change that is replacing white dominance with nouveau-riche "black diamonds" like herself. Nancy owns three restaurants, as well as a diamond cutting and importing business. And she's just getting started. It's on her relentless quest to expand her financial gains that Nancy introduces us to the extraordinary cast of characters circling in her orbit.

2)  Power of Song 
Tiken Jah Fakoly is a star. A magnetic presence, he's mobbed everywhere he goes. A celebrated reggae singer from the Ivory Coast, he was born into a family of traditional West African griots, wandering musicians and social commentators. So it's not surprising that for him the personal and political are both something to sing about. He enjoys all the trappings of stardom: lucrative recording contracts, wildly successful albums, and fiercely loyal fans who pack his stadium concerts across Africa and abroad. And yet Jah Fakoly doesn't fit the usual notion of a huge music celebrity. His fearlessness in using songs to take aim at politicians has had a personal cost: he lives in exile in Mali and has been declared persona non grata in Senegal. Clearly not afraid of controversy, Jah Fakoly reveals to us why his music is about passionate love of country and a fierce commitment to social justice. In this music-filled hour, we follow Jah Fakoly as he makes an emotional journey to sing once again in his beloved homeland. And we travel with him from the stage to the two village schools that he funds, all part of his pledge to fight for the poor and marginalized. Because Jah Fakoly fiercely believes that the real freedom all Africans deserve will only start when education is accessible to all. This is an intimate portrait of one of Africa's most powerful and charismatic voices for change.

3)  The Modern Warrior 
More and more people across Africa are streaming toward the continent's cities, hoping to invent new lives in the bustling urban centres. Nairobi, Kenya's energetic capital, is home to a massive influx of immigrants, exiles and dreamers. This metropolis of skyscrapers and slums is the backdrop for an absorbing tale of two clashing worlds. Moses ole Samante is an ambitious young Maasai who traveled from his traditional homeland in the countryside to carve out a life in Nairobi, the largest city in east Africa. Although he was mugged on his first wide-eyed day in the city, Moses now runs a successful safari business - and is full of hope for his family and his nation. But Moses is caught between the traditional life that nurtures him and the one that opens him up to the world. He is a force of change for his Maasai community, as an advocate of education, but he also fights to preserve his people's way of life. When we meet Moses, we see that making his dreams a reality, both for his people and for himself, is a balancing act that brings him back and forth between city and village, and then across the continent.

4)  A Woman's World 
In Africa, as in so many other places, sports have traditionally been a man's world. And until recently, women entered at the risk of being scorned or laughed at. But the amazing Sahar El-Hawary and her female soccer team are no joke. She is the first women's referee in North Africa and also the first female member of the Egyptian Football Federation. And she has put women's soccer on the map - not just in her native Egypt but also in the entire Arab world. We follow Sahar through poor and middle-class neighbourhoods of Cairo, a chaotic mega-city that's home to 20 million people. It's here she recruits young women as soccer players and potential referees. Sahar is determined to break down all barriers in her patriarchal Muslim society, but not everyone is willing to change. We meet a young player from a poor area whose family is against women playing sports. Meeting her brothers, we get a sense of the frustrations faced by young Egyptians, who wrestle with restrictions imposed by tradition in many areas of their lives, from sports to romantic relationships.
