Plot :
Lucknow-based Zeenat Jahan Begum lives with her widower father, Nawab Mirza Sultan, and Kariban Bua. Despite losing their riches, they rent part of their mansion, pretend to be wealthy, eat Kichdi and call it Dal Pulav. She is in love with Yusuf and would like to marry him. When her father arranges her marriage, she assumes it is with Yusuf, but is in for a shock when she finds that her groom is wealthy Nawab Sikander Mirza. Dressed as a bride she goes to seek shelter with Yusuf but is told by his maternal uncle, Mir Qurban Ali, that Yusuf does not love her and has re-located to Allahabad for three months. She returns home but her disgraced and enraged father asks her to leave. She then attempts to go to her in-laws but is unable to speak freely with her 'husband'. Devastated she turns to the Dhargah, passes out, and when awakens - finds herself in a brothel run by Naziran Bai...

If you are a fan of period or Muslim dramas than this is the movie for you. The period or ambiance shown in this picture may look strange to today's genre, but there was and is such male dominated rigid societies where women are mere subjects, they do not have any say regarding any affairs of home and the world. This film has brilliant performances by an expert cast. Naaz's performance is excellent and you will never forget her. She was a talent remained untapped otherwise. Meena Kumari is good too and so are Pradeep and Ashok Kumar. The Haveli culture shown in this one is itself a treat to watch with a few light moments with redoubtable Johnny Walker.

This movie has some superhit vintage songs which is listed in the above posters.
