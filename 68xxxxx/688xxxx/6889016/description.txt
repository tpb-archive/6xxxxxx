Stu is getting married. Along with Doug, Phil, and his soon-to-be brother-in-law 

Teddy, he regretfully invites Alan to Thailand for the wedding. After a quiet night

 on the beach with a beer and toasting marshmallows by the camp fire, Stu, Alan and

 Phil wake up in a seedy apartment in Bangkok. Doug is back at the resort, but Teddy

 is missing, there's a monkey with a severed finger, Alan's head is shaved, Stu has a

 tattoo on his face, and they can't remember any of it. The wolf-pack retrace their

 steps through strip clubs, tattoo parlors and cocaine-dealing monkeys on the streets

 of Bangkok as they try and find Teddy before the wedding
