CRF encoding maintains a constant quality across episodes by adjusting the required file size (bit-rate) to maintain the desired quality. Some scenes/episodes need a higher bit-rate than others. CRF...never underestimate or waste how many bits are used. The high profile x264 settings provide greater compression, while maintaining the crf-19. i.e. CRF-19 at lower x264 settings would have the same quality, but would result in larger files.
