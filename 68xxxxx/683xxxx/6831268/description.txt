Forensic Dental Evidence, Second Edition provides the base for investigating, identifying and processing forensic dental evidence. This edition leads off with an explanation of dental nomenclature and quickly advances to the newest developments in trace dental evidence, methods for trace DNA evidence, and mass disaster cases (9/11, Bali, Thailand). Bowers covers how digital imaging of evidence has assisted in cases where incarcerated individuals have been exonerated. This volume provides the necessary tools and practical suggestions for forensic scientists and investigators charged with analysis of a crime scene. With an emphasis on the proper use of scientific methods, knowledge of analytical limitations and the necessity for team training, planning and multi-level management, Forensic Dental Evidence, Second Edition provides invaluable practical information. Contemporary cases and interesting historic cases, including an Egyptian mummy and Adolf Hitler, demonstrate relevant case methods.
