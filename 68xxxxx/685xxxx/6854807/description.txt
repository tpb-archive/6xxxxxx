Lifehouse - You and Me LYRICS

What day is it
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can\\\'t keep up, and I can\\\'t back down
I\\\'ve been losing so much time

\\\'Cause it\\\'s you and me
And all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it\\\'s you and me
And all the other people
And I don\\\'t know why
I can\\\'t keep my eyes off of you

Why are the things that I want to say
Just aren\\\'t coming out right?
I\\\'m tripping on words
You got my head spinning
I don\\\'t know where to go from here

\\\'Cause it\\\'s you and me
And all of the people people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it\\\'s you and me
And all other people
And I don\\\'t know why
I can\\\'t keep my eyes off of you

Something about you now
That I can\\\'t quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

\\\'Cause it\\\'s you and me 
And all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it\\\'s you and me and all of the people
And I don\\\'t know why
I can\\\'t keep my eyes off of you and me
And all the other people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it\\\'s you and me and all the other people 
And I don\\\'t know why
I can\\\'t keep my eyes off of you

What day is it
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
