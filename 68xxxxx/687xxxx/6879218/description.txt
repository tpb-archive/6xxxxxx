On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen Kingâ€™s heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassinationâ€”a thousand page tour de force.

Following his massively successful novel Under the Dome, King sweeps readers back in time to another momentâ€”a real life momentâ€”when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.


Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the studentsâ€”a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunningâ€™s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.

Not much later, Jakeâ€™s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insaneâ€”and insanely possibleâ€”mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jakeâ€™s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jakeâ€™s lifeâ€”a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.

A tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.
