This is a reupload of my torrent from 2008. This time the files are uncompressed to avoid errors. I have also included some additional files required for playing online

Star Trek Elite Force II for PC. This torrent includes both the CD ISO's uncompressed plus patch v1.1 and master server fix for playing online

The master server patch is required to play online as the original master server for the game is down/offline



Eliteforce II online community - my EF2 server listed under favourites:

www.x%fire.com/co%mmun%iti%es/el%itefor%ce2  (remove the % signs from url)

 

How to install and use:

Download and install daemon tools or Virtual Clone Drive. Mount CD1/ISO1 in the program of your choice and run the installer. Mount CD2/ISO2 in the same virtual drive when asked for CD2 and so on. Alternativly you could burn the iso's to two CD's

Patches and maps:

This game has a vast amount of mods and maps available for use. Go to eli%tefo%rce2.fi%lefr%ont.com (remove the % signs from url) to download them. Please ensure you install the 1.1 patch and master server fix in order to play online. 

All mods/maps/skins (excluding self installing ones) must be unzipped and placed in the Elite force II base folder in order to work, the files should be in .pk3 form in order to work. 

Master server fix (required to play online):

The master server fix included in this torrent is a batch file. Feel free to open it in a text editor to see what it does. All it does is alter the windows hosts file to point ef2 to the backup master server IP address which is run by the community. Some people might need to temporarily disable their antivirus to install the patch as some antivirus software block altering of the windows hosts file. Please note if you are running windows vista/7 you MUST run the master server fix as an administrator.

Cracks/CD Keys:
No fixed EXE is needed. The cd key is: HJJJ-FXX7-WHTX-W4AK-9702. This key can be used to play online.

ENJOY
