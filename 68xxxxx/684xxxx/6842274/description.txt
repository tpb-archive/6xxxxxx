Hello everybody,

Now then as some of you might know, I was made 
to go off round the country earlier on this year 
and do a show to loads of people. It wasn't my 
idea, I was made to do it by that lot what pull 
all the strings. I went everywhere, up north, down 
south and I even had to go to Scotland, but you have 
to do these things you see. If I'd have had my way I 
wouldn't have gone, I'd have stayed at home with my feet 
up watching Dragons Den with a box of Magnums, but it wasn't 
my way..So in the end what happened was, I got to this one 
place in Digbeth, which is in Birmingham and they've got a 
load of video cameras there and they say right we're gonna 
film this and I shrugged my shoulders and said OK. So they 
did and this is what you've got in your hands, the DVD of 
it, so have a look at it and see what you think.

OK bye,
From Angelos
