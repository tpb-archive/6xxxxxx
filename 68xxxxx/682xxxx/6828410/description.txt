Plot

Alice Bonnard (Charlotte Alexandra), a 14-year old girl attending a boarding school in France, comes home for the summer. She flashes back to her time at school, where she frequently masturbated out of boredom. Her father (Bruno Balp) hires a young man named Jim (Hiram Keller), who Alice immediately becomes infatuated with. Alice has a graphic sexual fantasy in which Jim has tied her to the ground with barbed wire, and is trying to insert an earthworm into her vagina. When the earthworm will not fit, Jim tears it into small pieces and puts them in Alice's pubic hair.

She begins dating halfway through the summer. She is taken to a carnival by a middle-aged man, who exposes himself to her on a ride. She then arrives home and sees her father's penis. She exposes herself to Jim, and the two masturbate in front of each other, to Alice's chagrin. She discovers her father is having an affair, and Jim tries pressuring her into having sex. He is then shot and killed by a trap Alice's father set up in the garden to keep out intruders.
