May 15 1984. In a bar, shortly after a shady deal took place two men enter the bar. They are undercover cops, and once the criminal notices them, he flees the bar, and as his motorcycle skims past town, the pick-up truck used by the undercover cops isn't capable of keeping up when the criminal goes past a fence into an open field. However, while escaping, he left something very important behind. Three days later, someone breaks one of the agents' house. Inside, John and Jackie Ryan are brutally assassinated by an unknown hitman. Their son Jake witnesses everything hidden from the closet in his parent's room.

11 years pass by, and Jake Ryan, living with his grandmother since the incident, joins the Academy and graduates with flying colours. His parents' death turned into a cold case, despite the best attempts by Lyle Jamison, one of John's closest friends and P.I. to bring the criminals into justice. As he is assigned to the local Jackson Beach PD, he learns that stolen National Guard weapons are suspected to be circulating in the area, and one night something catches Jake's eye that might bring him closer to the truth...

Designed by former Police Quest mastermind Jim Walls, Blue Force is an adventure game mostly similar to Walls' previous games with Sierra, where real police procedures are blended into the gameplay. Visually it is also inspired by late SCI engine games, with carefully crafted backgrounds overlayed with video-captured sprites as characters. Interface, however, is different, as the player has the complete inventory on the bottom side of the screen and actions (walk, look talk and use) can be reached using the right button.
