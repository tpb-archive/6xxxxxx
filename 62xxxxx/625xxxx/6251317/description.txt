1 | Franky | Franky Fitzgerald | January 27, 2011 |

The episode starts with the introduction of Franky, a shy, isolated girl who is starting her first day at Roundview. There, she draws the ire of Mini, the queen bee of her group, caused by a violent hockey game and exacerbated by Mini's dim view of Franky's fashion sense. Franky is approached by best friends Alo and metalhead Rich, who are also outsiders, and hope to befriend her. However, Mini, seeking a new start, pushes them aside and join her with her two friends, Grace and Liv. They invite her into their group, proceed to take Mephedrone and go shopping. However, Mini starts to antagonise Franky, who rejects her materialistic outlook on life, and looks to steal Grace and Liv away. Mini persuades boyfriend Nick to post embarrassing photos of Franky around the college, which leads to Mini and Franky falling out. After meeting the mysterious Matty, who relates to her, Franky draws strength to confront Mini. After doing so at a party, Grace, who had displayed a genuine interest in Franky from the beginning, leaves. Grace, along with Alo and Rich, stops Franky in the street, pushes her into Rich and Alo's van, and take her to a local swimming pool, where they unite as a gang of their own. By tempting Grace away, Franky has caused a split in Miniâ€™s group. First appearances of Franky, Alo, Rich, Mini, Nick, Grace, Liv and Matty.

Rich is a heavy metal fan and when he puts his taste in music on at a party, it doesnâ€™t go down well with the other party goers so Rich and Alo get kicked out.

Franky asks Grace to help Rich with his girl problems but Mini and Liv turn up and is not happy to see Franky there. Grace goes to see Rich in disguise and offers to help him but he wonâ€™t compromise and ends up insulting her. Later at a pub Rich bumps into Grace who is dressed as a â€œmetal headâ€ . It becomes clear that Grace likes Rich but he is oblivious to it so he asks out â€œthe angel of deathâ€ but she rejects him. He then buys a record and deafens himself. In anger he rips up his Napalm Death tickets and goes to see Graceâ€™s dance recital and begins to cry during her performance. Grace has extra Napalm Death tickets so Rich and Grace go together. The next morning Rich gets his hearing back and realises Grace likes him when he receives a text from her. He asks for advice from his dad and confronts Grace about his feelings for her but can't get up the courage to say anything. As Grace walks off with Mini, Liv and Nick she does a sly Rock sign with her hand. Matty is absent from this episode.

After playing strip games, Liv and Rider end up having sex and Nick thinks itâ€™s time that he and Mini should as well. A nervous Mini ends up being sick on Nick so Liv and Nick take her home.

5 | Nick | Nick Levan | February 24, 2011 |

Nick's success on the pitch continues, and Matty has been allowed to re-enter the family home, subject to a contract. It's clear that Matty is on thin ice but, after persuading Professor Blood, he is nevertheless allowed to re-enroll in college, on probation. Matty continues his relationship with Liv, to Nick's clear irritation. While Matty has sex with Liv in their house, Nick visits Mini and massages her, leading to awkward sex. Later the atmosphere between the foursome is rather tense and silent, but Nick introduces Matty to the gang, who take to him almost immediately. Nick's anxiety is once again clear, and shows when he reacts angrily to a comment from his friend Ryder about Matty and Liv, and subsequently creases him with a hard tackle on the field. To cool off he joins the gang at a local for a few drinks, and with a tense atmosphere building with himself, Liv and Mini, he gets the Sambucas rolling. After overdoing it and regurgitating he emerges from the bathroom to find Mini dancing closely with a smug Ryder. As Nick reprimands Mini, Matty tries to intervene, and when Ryder speaks out of turn again he ends up on the receiving end of a left hook from Nick, who then abruptly leaves when Mini reveals her knowledge of his infidelity. Matty later finds him on the rugby pitch, and challenges him to a friendly 1 on 1 match, and is defeated easily by his more stable brother. His frustration boils over and he reveals the torment caused by Matty's re-emergence. Matty denies being the cause of his problems. Seeking solace in his father, which is ignored, Nick then takes his frustrations out on the kitchenware with his father's driver. Matty returns home and tells him to leave, presumably planning on taking the blame. Nick runs off into the darkness. The following morning he attempts to climb onto Liv's balcony, only to fall and for her to dismiss him. He then happens upon a prostitute leaving the house of a punter. Seeing his state she invites him home, where he takes cocaine and has sex with her but is clearly disturbed by photographs of her children. Frankie later finds him alone on a swing-set near her house and talks sense into him. Spurred on, Nick marches into his coach's office and announces he is quitting rugby, much to the coach's chagrin. He bids the team farewell and leaves. He goes home to find Matty prepared to leave home again, however Nick informs his father he wrecked the house, which his father refuses to believe. Nick confronts his father for his tactless attitude, and he eventually relents. Nick and Matty pile his father's motivational material, including a book he wrote and the contract, in the back garden, and burn it. The Levan Brothers then crack open a beer and watch the fire.

6 | Alo | Alo Creevey | March 3, 2011 |

It is Alo's birthday, not that his domineering mother or henpecked father actually care. Rather than allowing him to visit his friends in town, they force him to stay and work on the farm. Whilst working with his father, Alo attempts to push a large rock away, which his father tells him cannot be done, prompting Alo's further attempts. After Alo runs off while he is meant to be working, his parents reveal that they intend to withdraw him from Roundview College in order to force him to buckle down on the farm. Later Alo is given a list of tasks, and instead hides in Bessy the cow's stable. He accidentally drops his burning spliff onto a tank of propane, blowing up part of the stable and Bessy. His mother and father take everything he owns as punishment, including his van and beloved dog Rags, to be sold. Burning with rage and finally reaching his limit, he invites the gang over to the farm for an impromptu party, which he hopes will trash the farmhouse. While at the party, Liv questions Franky of her sexuality to which she does ot reply. When Alo's parents return to find the teenagers fleeing the scene (Alo had mentioned that his father carried guns), Alo drunkenly confronts his aghast family and berates his father for allowing his mother to henpeck him all the time, calling him "gormless and old." To his and his mother's horror, his father collapses and his mother immediately orders him to call an ambulance. Alo goes to Nick's house, where he is continuing the party from earlier, as his father is gone for the week. Franky, wanders upstairs to discover Liv and Matty having sex in his bedroom. She leaves with tears in her eyes, and Matty sees this, though he doesn't mention it to Liv. Alo goes to Rich's house, where Rich confesses that he has had sex with Grace. Rich is exuberant about growing up, which prompts Alo to leave without telling him what is wrong. Alo goes to the hospital, where he sees the farmhand and his dog, Rags. The farmhand tells him that his father is fine, but he had known about getting worse; he hadn't told Alo because he didn't want him to worry. Alo returns home and pledges to his mother that he will try harder and "grow up," but demands that she makes an effort too, as she is too domineering. This encounter moves her to tears. On the farm, Alo ties a rope around the stubborn rock and hooks it to the tractor, where he tries to pull it out of the ground, and is successful with the help of his father.

They continue the argument in the morning at rehearsal, where Rich confesses that he doesn't know if they are right for each other.
