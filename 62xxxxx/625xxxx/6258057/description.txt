Ratcatcher is set in Glasgow, 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, has some schemes with the poorest housing conditions in western Europe, such as no running hot water, no bathing facilities and no indoor toilet. The city is mid-way through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes and re-housing the tenants in new modern estates. The problems in these schemes are somewhat compounded by the binmen going on strike, creating an additional health hazard and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 12-year old boy, growing up in one of these schemes, which is gradually emptying, as the re-housed tenants move out. James, with the rest of his family, patiently waits to be re-housed. The film opens with James possibly contributing to the death of his pal, Ryan, by failing to raise the alarm when Ryan fails to surface after the two boys have a tussle in the local canal. James leaves the scene, unsure, and apparently unseen. This event comes back to haunt him at critical points in the film. The film follows the sensitive James as he tries to come to terms with his guilt, make sense of the insensitive aspects of his environment, from his heavy-drinking father to the local peer culture, and as, one by one, his hopes of a brighter future appear to be dashed.

Review from the New York Criterion (www.criterion.com/films/716):
â€œUtilizing beautiful, elusive imagery, candid performances, and unexpected humor, Ratcatcher deftly contrasts urban decay with a rich interior landscape of hope and perseverance, resulting in a work at once raw and deeply poeticâ€.
