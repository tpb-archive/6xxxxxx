                       By The Name Of Allah

Many Muslim preachers discuss the End of Time and the hadiths of seditions, warfare and the portents of the Last Hour in a way that suggests, in brief, that disbelief is growing stronger and Islam is abating; that evil is triumphing and goodness is being defeated; that vicious people are the victorious, whereas virtuous people and the advocators of righteousness are vanquished.
 
Which means that there is no hope for a change or faith in setting things aright. That we are moving from bad to worse, and from worse to the worst, for no day elapses but its morrow is still eviler, until the Last Hour befalls. 
 
Undoubtedly, this is a grave mistake that arises from a misconception of what is stated in some partial text passages combined with an omission of many conclusive crystal-clear auspices that the future belongs to Islam and Allah will surely make that religion superior over all other religions, however deeply averse disbelievers are to it.
 
Therefore, we must discuss these (Auspices) and spread them amongst the Muslims, in order to inspire hope that motivates willpower and defeat despair that kills souls.
 
Thanks to Allah these auspices are many. Some of them are quoted from the Noble Qurâ€™an and the Muhammadan Sunnah, while others are derived from history, the actual time and the Laws of Allah in His Creation.
 
We shall discuss each of these auspices in the next pages as Allah may bestow.
