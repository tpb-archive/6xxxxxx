Garfield, the fat, lazy, lasagna lover, has everything a cat could want. But 
when Jon, in an effort to impress the Liz - the vet and an old high-school 
crush - adopts a dog named Odie and brings him home, Garfield gets the one 
thing he doesn't want. Competition. One night Odie runs away and gets dog-napped
after Garfield locks him outside. Garfield, in an out of character move, goes 
to search for and rescue Odie with the help of a variety of animal friends 
along the way.
