The purpose of this web site is to provide you with an introduction to a series of devices which have been shown to have very interesting properties and some are (incorrectly) described as 'perpetual motion' machines.

What's that you say - perpetual motion is impossible?   My, you're a difficult one to please.   The electrons in the molecules of rock formations have been spinning steadily for millions of years without stopping - at what point will you agree that they are in perpetual motion?

So, why don't electrons run out of energy and just slow down to a standstill?   Quantum Mechanics has shown that the universe is a seething cauldron of energy with particles popping into existence and then dropping out again.   If E = mC2, then we can see that a tremendous amount of energy is needed to create any form of matter.   Scientists remark that if we could tap even a small part of that energy, then we would have free energy for our lifetime.

The Law of Conservation of Energy is undoubtedly correct when it shows that more energy cannot be taken out of any system than is put into that system.   However, that does not mean that we cannot get more energy out of a system than we put into it.   A crude example is a solar panel in sunlight.   We get electrical power out of the panel but we do not put the sunlight into the panel - the sunlight arrives on its own.   This example is simple as we can see the sunlight reaching the solar panel.

If, instead of the solar panel, we had a device which absorbs some of the energy which Quantum Mechanics observes and gives out, say, electrical power, would that be so different?   Most people say "yes! - it is impossible!" but this reaction is based on the fact that we cannot see this sea of energy.   Should we say that a TV set cannot possibly work because we cannot see a television transmission signal?

Many people have produced devices and ideas for tapping this energy.   The energy is often called "Zero-Point Energy" because it is the energy which remains when a system has its temperature lowered to absolute zero.   This presentation is introductory information on what has already been achieved in this field: devices which output more power than they require to run.   This looks as if they contradict the Law of Conservation of Energy, but they don't, and you can see this when you take the zero-point energy field into account.

The material on this web site describes many different devices, with diagrams, photographs, explanations, pointers to web sites, etc.   As some of the devices need an understanding of electronic circuitry, a simple, step-by-step instruction course in electronics is also provided in Chapter 12.   This can take someone with no previous knowledge of electronics, to the level where they can read, understand, design and build the type of circuits used with these devices.

This is a very interesting field and the topic is quite absorbing once you get past the "it has to be impossible" attitude.   We were once told that it would be impossible to cycle at more than 15 mph as the wind pressure would prevent the cyclist from breathing.   Do you want to stay with that type of 'scientific' expert?   Have some fun - discover the facts.

There are many, many interesting devices and ideas already on the web.   This site does not mention them all by any means.   What it does, is take some of what are in my opinion, the most promising and interesting items, group them by category, and attempt to describe them clearly and without too many technical terms.   If you are not familiar with electronics, then some items may be difficult to understand.   In that case, I suggest that you start with Chapter 12 and go through it in order, moving at whatever speed suits you, before examining the other sections.   I hope you enjoy what you read.

The main information on this web site has been gathered together into a standard book format.   You can download the main set of information, including the patents, as an eBook, using this link eBook Release 18.4.   The document contains some 2,200 pages and has a file size of about 32 Mb which means that it will take some time to download.   It is also possible to use a background download from fileFactory.   Alternatively, you can pick individual chapters as you wish.   May I suggest that you store anything you download on your local drive as web sites do not remain in place for ever.   The last few updates to this document are listed here. This eBook gets updated once per week on average, so I suggest that you download an updated copy say, once per month.
