Released on June 25, 1999 for the PlayStation in Japan,Metal Gear Solid: Integral is an expanded version of the original game based on the North American localization. The original Japanese voices are replaced with the English dub, while offering a choice between Japanese and English captions, and there is an extra disc of virtual reality training missions dubbed the "VR Disc".Added to the main game are an alternate sneaking suit outfit for Meryl to complement Snake's tuxedo and the red-colored Ninja, a "Very Easy" difficulty setting where the player starts their mission with an MP5 sub-machine gun with infinite ammo, new Codec frequencies with staff commentary and hidden music, a first-person view mode, an option for alternate patrol routes for enemies, and a downloadable PocketStation minigame.

The "VR Disc" features over 300 missions testing the player's sneaking and fighting skills, as well as less conventional tests, such as murder mysteries, battling giant genome soldiers, and three missions where the player controls the Cyborg Ninja. Special features include trailers for Metal Gear Solid, a preview artwork of Metal Gear RAY from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and a "photoshoot" mode to take pictures of Mei Ling and Naomi.

The VR Disc from Integral was released as a separate product outside of Japan â€” in North America as Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions (September 23, 1999) and in Europe as Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions (October 29, 1999). When loading Special Missions, the player is prompted to replace the game disk with either of the disks from Metal Gear Solid. If the disk is correctly identified, the player can insert the Special Missions disk and the game will then load as normal. This requirement was absent from the American VR Missions and Japanese VR Disc. Special Missions cannot be played on pre-SCPH-70000 PlayStation 2 consoles, as it will not recognize either Metal Gear Solid disk, but the game is compatible with other consoles.

A PC port of Integral was also released in Europe and North America in late 2000 with PocketStation support removed. Scoring 83 in Metacritic's aggregate, the game was criticized for "graphic glitches", the aged nature of the port, and being essentially identical to the PlayStation version.
