StoryLine: 
*********

Cleopatra, the famed Egyptian Queen born in 69 B.C., is shown to have been 
brought by Roman ruler Julius Caesar at age 18. Caesar becomes sexually 
obsessed by the 18 year old queen, beds her, and eventually has a son by her. 
However, his Roman followers and his wife are not pleased by the union. In fact, 
as Caesar has only a daughter by his wife, he had picked Octavian as his 
successor. The out-of-wedlock son of Cleopatra is seen to be a threat to his 
future leadership. Thus Brutus and other Roman legislators plot the assassination
of Caesar. Caesar's loyal general, Marc Antony, and Octavian then divide up the 
Roman empire. Antony takes Egypt and soon takes up the affair with Cleopatra. 
However, Octavian soon launches an attack on Antony and ultimately defeats and 
mortally wounds him. Rather than permitting herself to be humiliated by Octavian,
Cleopatra sends her son away to India and she commits suicide by permitting the 
deadly asp to bite her.
