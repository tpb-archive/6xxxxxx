Set in 1872, the story focuses on Passepartout, a Chinese thief who steals a 
valuable jade Buddha and then seeks refuge in the traveling companionship of an 
eccentric London inventor and adventurer, Phileas Fogg, who has taken on a bet 
with members of his gentlemen's club that he can make it around the world in a 
mere 80 days, using a variety of means of transportation, like boats, trains, 
balloons, elephants, etc. Along the way, Passepartout uses his amazing martial 
arts abilities to defend Fogg from the many dangers they face.. One major threat 
to their adventure is a detective that's following them. Why? Just as Fogg and 
Passeportout left London, a major bank was robbed, with Fogg suspected of using 
the "around the world" trip as an excuse to escape.. Their path from London and 
back includes stops in Paris, Turkey, India, China and USA..
