Ricky Santoro is a flamboyant and corrupt Atlantic City cop with a dream: 
become so well connected that he can become mayor. In lieu of that, he'll 
settle for keeping his comfortable lifestyle. On the night of the heavyweight 
boxing championship, Rick becomes mixed up in the assassination of the Secretary 
of Defense, an assassination involving his best friend. Becoming the investigating 
officer in the case, Rick soon uncovers a conspiracy to kill the Secretary and a 
mysterious woman in white. The conspiracy was shocking, but not half as shocking 
as the identity of its mastermind.
