In the 1960s, Frances "Baby" Houseman, a sweet daddy's girl, goes with her 
family to a resort in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. Baby has grown up 
in privileged surroundings and all expect her to go on to college, join the Peace 
Corps and save the world before marrying a doctor, just like her father. 
Unexpectedly, Baby becomes infatuated with the camp's dance instructor, Johnny, 
a man whose background is vastly different from her own. Baby lies to her father 
to get money to pay for an illegal abortion for Johnny's dance partner (Johnny 
is not the father). She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner and it is as he 
is teaching her the dance routine that they fall in love. It all comes apart when 
Johnny's friend falls seriously ill after her abortion and Baby gets her father, 
who saves the girl's life. He then learns what Baby has been up to, who with and 
worse - that he funded the illegal abortion..
