StoryLine: 
*********

Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth, Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and 
the hapless prehistoric squirrel/rat known as Scrat are still together and 
enjoying the perks of their now melting world. Manny may be ready to start a 
family, but nobody has seen another mammoth for a long time; Manny thinks he 
may be the last one. That is, until he miraculously finds Ellie, the only 
female mammoth left in the world. Their only problems: They can't stand each 
other--and Ellie somehow thinks she's a possum! Ellie comes with some excess 
baggage in the form of her two possum "brothers"-- Crash and Eddie, a couple 
of daredevil pranksters and cocky, loud-mouthed troublemakers. Manny, Sid and 
Diego quickly learn that the warming climate has one major drawback: A huge 
glacial dam holding off oceans of water is about to break, threatening the 
entire valley. The only chance of survival lies at the other end of the valley.
