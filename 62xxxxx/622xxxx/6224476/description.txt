An evil scientist has used genetic engineering to create a race of rampaging monsters. As a fellow scientist you must take back a chain of islands by breeding your own creatures that are faster, smarter, more aggressive, and faster at breeding. Raise your creatures in a lab where you can mate them, examine them, and even create random mutations by introducing radiation into the environment.
