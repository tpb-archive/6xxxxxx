description:

Conduit 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by High Voltage Software for the Wii video game console. It is the sequel to The Conduit. The developers called the game Conduit 2 because they felt the original name of The Conduit 2 was "too much of a mouthful" so they dropped the "The".
The game makes use of the Quantum3 engine, a game engine designed by High Voltage Software specifically for the Wii. The engine allows effects such as bump mapping, reflection and refraction, and gloss and detail mapping to be implemented. Conduit 2 will support a wide variety of peripherals such as Wii MotionPlus, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, and the PDP Headbanger Headset.




Conduit 2's single player mode has had many changes from the first game. Players have the ability to flip over objects such as tables, bookshelves and soda machines to use as cover, and shoot off enemy armor and helmets to expose weak spots.[8][9] A sprint button has been added to allow players to charge or flee from opponents.[8] Players can ride on vehicles in certain levels and fire weapons from them.[10] At the beginning of levels, players can choose their weapon loadouts, and customize their character's appearance and ability upgrades.[9][11] The use of iron sights has been implemented, and grenades explode on a timer.[12] Levels are less "corridor-based" in design, with multiple paths to explore.[8] The game's story unfolds during gameplay through triggered scripted sequences instead of through cutscenes as in the first game.[8] Enemy AI has been enhanced; to make them appear more lifelike, enemies will have conversations between themselves when they're unaware of the players presence.[13][14] The enemies can flip and knock over things like tables and filing cabinets for makeshift cover, and enemies will blind fire when players aim at them while they're behind cover.[8][13] The enemies possess randomized weapons. The enemy AI behavior also changes depending on which weapon they have. For example, a foe with a shotgun will attempt to run up to the player to shoot him at close range, while a foe with a rifle will hang back and shoot from afar.[15] Enemy behavior also varies depending on which weapon the player is armed with. For example, enemies with try to search for players who have cloaked invisible with the ARC Eclipse rifle.[16] Enemies will dive out of the way of fragmentation grenades and attempt to suicide bomb the player when stuck with a radiation grenade. Enemies feature randomly selected armour pieces and helmets so that each enemy looks different.[9] Conduit 2 features 23 enemy types, as opposed to the first game which only had 14.[17] While Conduit 2 retains the customizable controls from the first game,[5] the game will support Wii MotionPlus for enhanced precision control and better tracking, though it is not required to play the game.[18] In addition, Conduit 2 supports the use of the Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro.[19]



High Voltage have stated that they intend to concentrate more on art and story - both areas which were criticized in The Conduit.[20][21] Conduit 2 takes place in many locations throughout the world.[21] The game will be set in Atlantis[22] in addition to Washington, D.C., Agartha, Siberia,[20] the Amazon, England and China.[23] Conduit 2 will feature 16 campaign missions at an estimated 6-8 hour length, as opposed to The Conduit's 9 missions at 4-6 hours.[17] The game will feature boss battles against large aliens, and 21[17] weapons, with additions such as the "Aegis Device" (known as the vortex cannon prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010) which catches rounds fired by opponents and then fires the collection of ammunition back at them, or a mobile turret that can be picked up and moved to different parts of a level, and remotely fired from behind cover, as well as the Phase Rifle; which is capable of firing through walls. Some weapons will be customizable. Most weapons will have a secondary fire mode.[24] Likewise, some weapons from the first game have been retooled to fire differently.[8] Various weapons and devices will return from the first game with some being improved upon, such as the All-Seeing-Eye or ASE, used to scan objects for use in a wide range of circumstances, such as data logs, force fields, and to discover hidden traps and unlockables.[5][8][22] While in the first game, the ASE emitted a sound in order to indicate nearby scannable objects, Conduit 2 features a manual sonar like "ping" system which helps indicate to players where scannable objects are hidden.



Multiplayer


Along with a standard single-player and multiplayer online modes, the title will feature four-player split-screen multiplayer with offline and online modes.[4] The online element will feature "increased security" over the first game to prevent hackers.[8] Bounty Hunter mode will be returning from the first game,[22] as well as a new Co-op mode which will feature "Invasion Mode", in which players will combat waves of enemies on the same console in split-screen mode.[25] The game allows up to 12 players to battle online, and will be one of the first Wii games to support the PDP Headbanger Headset, which allows voice chat between players without the need for exchanging friend codes.[4][22] In addition to the Wii's use of Friend Codes, the game will feature an "Ally System" in which a player can send friend requests to other players in the lobby to add to their friends list without having to exchange Friend Codes. Up to 96 friends can be listed.[26]



Conduit 2 will support patching to allow fixes to bugs and glitches in its online multiplayer.[9] Another feature added is the ability for players to revive fallen teammates.[27] The game will introduce different character classes, each with unique attributes, and allow the player to alter their characters appearance as well as unlock over 30 suit upgrades that bestow special skills, such as robotic legs that let the player to sprint greater distances.[5][22] Players will be able to switch between four different character classes during the course of a match, each with different player-defined weapons and upgrades.[5] The multiplayer will feature 12 maps, 14 game modes and 60 player rankings, whereas The Conduit only featured 7 maps, 9 game modes and 25 player rankings.[17] Conduit 2 will also feature female NPC skins for multiplayer, which were absent in the first game.[17] Conduit 2 features a currency system that allows players to earn experience points and medals that can be used to purchase weapons, upgrades and armor pieces to alter their characters look.[9][27] A new voting system will be implemented into the multiplayer which will allow players to choose between two online maps and game types when the player enters the lobby for a specific mode. There will also be a playlist featuring no radar and no lock-on
