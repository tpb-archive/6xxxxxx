The Hard Times of RJ Berger orbits the hilariously-hellish lives of a deeply unpopular 15 year-old (Paul Iacono) and his scheming, sex-obsessed best friend, Miles Jenner (Jareb Dauplaise). Other than pining after the girl of his dreams, Jenny Swanson (Amber Lancaster), receiving daily beatings from the meanest jock in school, Max Owens (Jayson Blair), and evading the stalker-ish advances of Lily Miran (Kara Taitz), there really isn\'t much excitement in RJ\'s life. That is, until his anatomical gift is accidentally exposed to the entire school. In a single moment, RJ goes from anonymous to infamous, and for the first time in his life, he feels a tiny sliver of confidence

RJ lands the lead role along with Jenny and find out that they share a kiss in one of the scenes. Lily, who is completely against this, tries to insert some doubt into RJ by saying he could mess things up entirely with Jenny if he kisses her wrong. Meanwhile, Miles tries to act cool in front of several girls at once, saying he taught RJ everything he knows about acting. Opening night comes, with RJ and Jenny getting nervous about the big kiss between them. They plan everything out between them and RJ gets even more nervous since he\'s afraid he may get a boner when he does. Miles duct tapes RJ\'s penis to his leg to help curb this and help RJ go through with the scene, inadvertantly giving RJ a limp in the process. The scene comes and RJ gets a boner as Jenny leans into him, ripping the duct tape and casting a large shadow on the background in the shape of a tent with the audience laughing at RJ and Jenny in disgust. The next day, Jenny apologizes to RJ and his parents are proud of him.
