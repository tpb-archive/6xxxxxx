In 1996, the horror master Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) unleashed Scream, a slasher movie aimed at a whole new generation of teenage movie-goers. Though premiering at a time when horror movies were in decline and plagued with an array of start up problems, Scream went on to shatter box-office records for horror films, earning well over $100 million in domestic box office receipts, revived Craven's career and turned first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson and a group of hot young television actors (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Rose McGowan) into overnight stars. The film became a huge success, spawned three sequels and single-handedly revived the horror genre. "Scream: The Inside Story" features all-new interviews with Wes Craven, Neve Campell, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan and Matthew Lillard along with the many other cast and crew.
