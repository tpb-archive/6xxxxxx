1 | There Goes the Neighborhood (Part 1) | Adam Kane | January 17, 2011 |

A vampire feeds on a young woman before calling someone for a clean up after he inadvertently kills her. A young man runs in the woods before transforming into a werewolf. The next day, the werewolf Josh, now human, again, meets up with the vampire Aidan, who gives him a change of clothes before they head for work at Suffolk County Hospital in Boston, where Aidan reveals to Josh that he found a cheap house for them to rent so they can feel more human. They soon meet Cara, the replacement for Rebecca, the woman Aidan killed the night before. Aidan also confronts Marcus, a vampire who works for Boston's head vampire Bishop, who is trying to use the hospital to recruit new vampires from terminally ill patients. When Josh and Aidan check out the house from its owner Danny, he reveals that his fiance died and he wants to move on. As Josh and Aidan begin to move in, Josh notices another person in the house, a young woman who introduces herself as Sally, who seems elated that someone can finally see her before Aidan reveals that she is a ghost. She explains that she knows about them, and that their non-human attributes allow them to see her, and she also states that she cannot leave the house or interact with anything in the physical world. At the hospital, Josh finds that his sister Emily is in town as Emily's girlfriend Jackie broke her arm in an accident. Emily wants to know where Josh has gone, but he will not tell her. At the hospital, Aidan finds a room in the basement that Josh can use so he can transform into a werewolf without anyone noticing. Bishop, who acts as a captain on the Boston police force, approaches Aidan who reveals that the police are looking to him as a suspect in Rebecca's disappearance. While he manages to tempt Aidan to follow him to a den where women give themselves to vampires. As he appears to get high from fresh blood, Josh heads to the room in the hospital basement as it is the night of the full moon, unaware that Emily is following him. By the time he notices, he tries to get Emily out of the room until she shuts the door which cannot open from the inside. Josh frantically calls Sally, who cannot pick up the phone, and Aidan to get to him before he kills his sister as a werewolf.

2 | There Goes the Neighborhood (Part 2) | Adam Kane | January 24, 2011 |

Aidan prevents Josh from harming his sister after being locked in a secured room with her while turning. Sally tries without avail to contact her fiance while he attempts to repair the apartment; learning from a conversation he has with Josh and Aidan that she died falling down the apartment's stairs in the night. Aidan learns from Josh that the girl (Rebecca) he believes he had killed in a moment of weakness and is believed missing by much of the populace, has been turned in to a vampire by Bishop; after she attempts to feed off of Josh before realizing that he is a werewolf. While Aidan attempts to persuade her in to not feeding, like him; she rebuffs his efforts. Following this, Aidan goes for a drink at a local bar by the apartment and encounters his coworker Cara, who openly flirts with him. While Aidan resists the urge to feed upon her, and calls Josh to come and help him should he fall off the wagon once more; Rebecca appears suddenly to pester Aidan. Rebecca taunts Aidan and Cara; Aidan attempts to get her to leave, and mentions her name in front of Cara; who believes that Rebecca is meant to be dead or missing. Cara quickly leaves, upset; as she believes that Aidan is with Rebecca. Rebecca then attempts to go home with a patron of the bar, only to be stopped by Aidan; who knows she is merely going to end up killing him. The man however; does not willingly turn down the opportunity, and attempts to fight Aidan. In the meantime; Rebecca slips out of the bar, attacking and feeding on Cara just before Josh gets to the bar. Aidan and Josh both try to save Cara from bleeding to death as Rebecca boasts about the feed and tells Aidan to save her by turning her in to a vampire, giving Aidan the moral dilemma of whether to keep her alive by damning her or to let her die. Not wishing to give Cara the fate without a choice, Aidan does not turn her and she subsequently dies. During the investigation on Cara's death, Bishop confronts Aidan on not turning her, as she would have been an asset for them; causing Aidan to tell his former mentor that while they both may end up in the same place in the end, he does not wish to rejoin the other vampires. Josh, having seen the struggle Aidan has to deal with in stopping himself from feeding, along with whether to turn Cara or not; tells Sally when she asks him whether Aidan should have saved Cara or not; that by letting her die, he was truly saving her from becoming a monster.

7 | I See Your True Colors... And That's Why I Hate You | Jeremiah Chechik | February 28, 2011 |

After Aidan realizes that Marcus is the one who attacked Emily, he tells Josh to leave town, and Emily has him take her back to their family home in Ithaca, New York, where he learns that his parents separated after he left. When their father who is a psychologist, comes home, he confronts Josh about his lycanthropy, which he believes is a psychosis. Back in Boston, Aidan confronts Bishop about Marcus's actions, but Bishop only says that it is how a werewolf would be treated after one attacks a vampire. Sally tries to haunt Danny, but he taunts her, saying her tactics are not scaring him. Josh tries to explain to his father that he is not suffering from a psychosis when Aidan drops by to try to help things, only for the garlic in Josh's mother's cooking to cause his vampire attributes to surface, and tries to assuage the transformation with various teas that Josh finds in the house. Sally eventually gets through to Bridget, telling her that Danny killed her. But Marcus arrives at the house, and Josh locks him out, with his father thinking he is having an attack. Aidan attacks Marcus as Josh breaks up a table to fashion into a stake, but Marcus leaves on his own accord. Josh admits to his family the truth about being a werewolf, and later talks with Aidan about revealing the truth to loved ones, deciding he will stay at home. Bridget confronts Danny about what Sally told her, and he lies, saying that the death was an accident, causing Bridget to tell Sally that she will no longer acknowledge her. Aidan meets up with Bishop to talk about Marcus, seeing several vampires meeting, telling them all that they must work to keep their weaknesses (Aidan) and mistakes (Marcus) in check to be stronger. Aidan returns to the house where Sally is upset about her failure to affect Danny, just as Josh comes in the door, having decided not to live with his family. In the countryside, Marcus goes to an Amish barn full of vampire bodies hanging from the ceiling, sleeping.

8 | Children Shouldn't Play with Undead Things | Jeremiah Chechik | March 7, 2011 |

At the bar, Josh, Aidan, and Sally spot Nora with one of the doctors from the hospital. Sally eavesdrops on the conversation to realize that it may be getting serious, but Josh chickens out when he attempts to talk to her. At the hospital the next day, Aidan shows Sally the old wing that is haunted by ghosts who have not been able to move on, and is scared off by the large group. Later that day, Aidan befriends a ten-year-old boy named Bernie who lives across the street from them and watches him until his mother Cindy comes home. Nora invites Josh over to her place, but that evening Josh realizes that it is one day away from the full moon. Sally convinces him to go out, and he does until he realizes he is growling when they get intimate and he leaves. The next day, as Aidan continues to watch over Bernie, Rebecca notices them and notes that Aidan must have been a father at some point. That night, Josh prepares to lock himself up in the hospital basement until Nora confronts him. The two have sex in the hospital, while back at the house, Aidan tells Bernie to get some Three Stooges DVDs from his room. Once Josh realizes that he has very little time left until the moon rise, he rushes home and transforms in the house, with Sally watching out of curiosity. The next day, as they clean up the mess from the wolf rampaging through the house, Cindy confronts Aidan as Bernie had accidentally taken the DVD of Rebecca having sex with and then killing another man, believing him to be a pedophile, even though Bernie admits he took it by mistake, and threatens Aidan to never speak to Bernie again. Josh reconciles with Nora as Aidan regrets losing the one thing reminding him of his long dead son and as Sally adds a message to the wall of the old hospital wing.

9 | I Want You Back (From the Dead) | Paolo Barzman | March 14, 2011 |

Nora and Josh grow closer, until Josh has a dream that he is slowly transforming into a werewolf in front of her, forcing him to decide to scale back their relationship. The next day, Aidan watches Bernie being bullied from afar after Cindy demanded he stay away, until Bernie is hit by a car when he reels back from the bullies. At the old wing of the hospital, Sally finds a message from Nicholas Fenn, one of her teaching assistants from college who she had a crush on who has died. They begin to hang out with each other until Nick starts choking on something and Sally watches him relive his drowning death in front of her. After Rebecca sees Aidan at the vampire den, she turns Bernie for Aidan, thinking it will cheer him up, but Aidan knows that children should not be made into vampires. Bernie believes he has superpowers now and plans on only using them to hurt bad people, but Aidan tells him he should not hurt any humans. Later, Aidan comes across a crime scene with the bullies killed and Bishop berates him for having turned a child. Sally tries to figure out a way to allow Nick to escape the reliving of his death, and realizes that she takes on her boyfriends' problems onto herself, but Nick reassures her that now that he is with her he has something good to come back to after the "echo". After telling Josh the events, Aidan later meets up with Rebecca and Bernie who is refusing hospital blood, and he promises to take Bernie out to learn how to get fresh blood without hurting anyone. Aidan takes Bernie to the woods to stalk a deer, and after telling Bernie to catch the deer if it escapes him, he walks behind Bernie and stakes him. Meanwhile, Bishop thanks Marcus for killing the two bullies, so Aidan would kill Bernie. Elsewhere, Josh confronts Nora about talking to Dr. Reid, and tries to tell her he is distancing himself from loved ones due to his condition. She reveals that one of her ex-boyfriends horribly burned her, and Josh promises that he will not let that happen to her again.

10 | Dog Eat Dog | Paolo Barzman | March 21, 2011 |

Coffins bearing "The Dutch" - thousand-year-old vampires from the Netherlands, living in Pennsylvania Dutch country - arrive in Boston. Upon awakening, they immediately begin imposing dicta concerning actions made by Bishop and the family. This evokes flashbacks from fifty years ago during the last time The Dutch were awake, chronicling Bishop's earlier fascinations and relationship with a human woman (and of Aidan's hectoring attitude that Bishop turn her). Josh is abducted by the vampires who reveal he is to serve as entertainment for The Dutch - a werewolf dog fight to the death. While imprisoned, Josh learns more about werewolves from an old man, revealed to be the other werewolf he will fight. Unable to physically help him, Sally tries to provide emotional support. Aidan attempts to interfere but the fight still takes place. Despite the other werewolf's greater size and experience, Josh is able to emerge victorious. However, the knowledge that he killed another causes Josh a lot of emotional trauma. Instead of being imprisoned and being forced to continue to fight, Josh is released which Aidan reveals was a condition of him returning to Bishop and the family. That night, Bishop confides in Aidan his fears that his command of Boston is coming to an end and that The Dutch mean to kill him.

11 | Going Dutch | Erik Canuel | March 28, 2011 |

Aidan and Bishop show the Dutch the blood den, where Bishop offers the Dutch each a woman to feed from, but the Dutch decide to suck all of them dry. Bishop reveals to Aidan that he knows that someone betrayed him and told the Dutch everything that has been happening in Boston, and Rebecca tells Aidan that she's disappointed that he's returned to Bishop. At work, Josh finds Nora and apologizes for disappearing, even though he cannot tell her the truth, just as Nora reveals that she is pregnant with Josh's child. Josh's fears about passing on the werewolf genes to the child cause him to upset Nora, who thinks that Josh is unsure of her faithfulness. When Josh finally sees Aidan, Aidan convinces him to accept the child as it brings him closer to having a human life. At the house, Sally watches Danny and Bridget visit with a woman who begins asking about the house. Sally believes that the woman is a real estate agent until the woman mentions an exorcism. Sally tries to fight the exorcist, but she is not strong enough. Marcus tries to align himself with the Dutch to take over Boston, but when that fails he tries to confide in Rebecca and reveals that he was the one who killed the children to frame Bernie. The Dutch reveal that they want Bishop to return with them after culling his family by two-thirds after they learn that he wants to bring vampires public. Josh finally manages to talk with Nora, saying that his amazement at her pregnancy was due to his family's bad genes and how he did not know if he could get anyone pregnant, and Nora also agrees that she was not sure if she could get pregnant for the same real reasons. At the house, Sally suffers from the continuing exorcism. When Bridget has qualms about what might happen to Sally's spirit once she is removed from the house, Danny takes her aside and tells the exorcist to continue. In a last ditch effort, Sally rushes the exorcist and possesses her, lashing out at Danny in the exorcist's body until he throws her against the wall, separating Sally from the exorcist. However, the exorcist has seen Sally's memories of her death and ends the ritual, saying that Danny deserves whatever Sally has in store for him. Bridget leaves Danny in the house, as an angry Sally stares at him with glassy eyes. Bishop holds a dinner for the Dutch, as both Aidan and Marcus abandon him, supporting the Dutch's requests. However, Bishop reveals that he had poisoned the Dutch by feeding the blood den women juniper, paralyzing the Dutch. He beheads three of them, leaving Hegemann for last until Aidan tries to save him. He leaves the funeral home and Marcus attacks him in support of Bishop, but he is staked through the heart by Rebecca, who helps Aidan and Hegemann escape. Hegemann warns Aidan that he must prepare for what is to come, and Rebecca asks Aidan to kill her, as she knows the vampires will want revenge for Marcus's death and how she knows that she was never meant to become a vampire. Aidan embraces her as he stakes her, putting her to rest.

12 | You're the One I Haunt | Erik Canuel | April 4, 2011 |

Before leaving for work, Aidan makes sure that Josh has enough wooden stakes on him to fend off the attacks of any of Bishop's vampires, but Josh merely thinks that Aidan is paranoid. Before they leave, Josh realizes that Sally has still not recovered from the exorcism and is looking ghastly. At the hospital, after Aidan nearly stakes an innocent man, he sees that his long lost love Celine is at the hospital. Aidan reminisces of the love they shared, including the tattoo of her name he has on his chest. When he finds her later, she tells him that she is going to die of lung cancer and wants to spend her last days in peace at the hospital. Josh finds Nora who says that she has been feeling the onset of morning sickness at only seven weeks of pregnancy and she reveals that her hCG levels are off the charts, which is either due to multiple fetuses or a birth defect, which worries Josh, but he remains steadfast in his support for her. Aidan's memories of Celine are further shown, revealing her pressuring to become a vampire, and Bishop's threatening visit, leading Aidan to want to take Celine on the run. Meanwhile, Sally visits Danny, scaring him before using her ghostly powers to make him cut himself while shaving, bringing her back to normal. Josh and Aidan discuss Nora's pregnancy until Jenny, a worker in the hospital's cafeteria whom Aidan remembers was compelled by Bishop in the past, attacks them, leaving Josh to stake her through the heart. When Josh sees Danny in the hospital getting stitches, Sally appears and reveals to Josh that she nearly killed Danny and revels in how it brought her back to normal. However after she returns to the house, Danny calls to see if the guys are home before entering with a can of gasoline, revealing to Sally that the exorcist told him that without the house to haunt, Sally will disappear. He sets fire to the living room and gets ready to leave, but Sally uses her ghostly abilities to trap him in the house until Aidan and Josh get home. Josh puts out the fire and Aidan attacks Danny, both revealing that they can see Sally and that they are not human. Aidan prepares to kill Danny at Sally's beckoning, but Josh pleads with both that Sally should not have a life on her hands. Sally aquiesces but then appears to Danny, saying that she will make his life a living hell unless he admits the arson and her murder to the police. Later, Nora has an ultrasound, and the obstetrician reveals that the baby is healthy, but Nora is revealed to be fourteen weeks pregnant rather than seven. Aidan goes to Celine, offering to turn her into a vampire now, but she declines, saying she does not want to watch her daughter and grandchildren grow old and die. Aidan also asks her why she was not home when he went to pick her up to take her out of Montreal, but she does not reveal to him that Bishop kidnapped her, raped her, drank her blood, and threatened her family. Later that night, the group toasts to Josh's future as a father and he also reveals that he wants to go back to medical school. They also toast to Sally for finally getting Danny the punishment he deserves just as her door to the other side appears in the living room. She is apprehensive about moving on, not sure of what will be on the other side, just as Bishop crashes through the house's front window and stakes Aidan, injuring him, before escaping.

Aidan eventually stabilizes, but Nora tells Josh they can't continue their relationship if can't bring himself to reveal his secrets. She decides, however, to keep the baby. Sally, who returned home at Aidan's request, finds that her door has dissapeared and that she can now interact with physical objects. Celine returns and comforts Aidan, revealing to him what Bishop did to her years ago and asking him to take her life to restore his. Hesitantly, Aidan drains Celine's blood which allows him to heal rapidly. At the hospital, Josh is accosted by Bishop, who says he wants to fight Aidan at a factory. Sally and Josh decide to protect Aidan by telling Bishop that Aidan wants to fight at the hospital basement. They plan to lock Bishop in the basement with Josh, who by then will have turned into a werewolf and will be able to kill Bishop. Josh leaves Nora a good-bye note and heads for the basement to transform. Aidan figures out what Josh is doing and has Sally lock him in the room alone and tells Bishop the fight will indeed be at the factory. However, Nora has followed Josh and enters the room to find him at the mid point of his transformation. Josh manages to shove her out of the room and lock the door before fully turning, with Nora watching in horror. Meanwhile Aiden and Bishop brutally beat each other in the factory. Bishop eventually gains the upper hand but is momentarily distracted by Sally. Aidan then strangles Bishop with some wiring and uses it to sever his head, killing him. The end of the episode sees Josh and Nora talking, with her deciding to remain with Josh despite knowing he is a werewolf. Josh tells her how he became infected by another werewolf who scratched him and killed his friend. As Josh leaves to check on his friends Nora pulls up her sleeve which shows three scratch marks accidentally given to her by Josh when he forced her out of the basement room the night prior. As Aidan, Sally and Josh celebrate Bishop's demise, Aidan answers the door expecting pizza delivery but is surprised to see Hegemann, who tells him that "she" wants to see him because Aidan is now the leader of Boston's vampires.
