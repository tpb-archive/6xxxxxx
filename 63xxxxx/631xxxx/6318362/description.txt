Here you have 10 books of the famous researcher into the area of lost teachings of the oldest people on Earth called Sumerians and their Gods (Annunaki)- Zecharia Sitchin. Although his proves were rejected by his fellow archaeologists on a serious ground - his knowledge of ancient Sumerian, language which never before, had been translated, we must ask ourselves of the challenge his theories pose to traditional archaeology view. We could find strange his vision of the Annunaki, Sumer, religious practices and beliefs of these people from the land Greeks named Mesopotamia, but who are we to judge a life's work only according to prejudices maintained, inculcated to us via mass-media by other humans, who after all could be jealous on his success, not proud of his contribution to humanity's understanding of who we are, what we are, where we come from. We must be careful not to make judgements before reading a man's work. It doesn't have to be the whole wisdom of the ages, but it offers an insight and that matters. We must doubt of everything we believed to have known before, in order to be enlightened.
