From producers Biwajima Shiyuuta and Niki Chikara (ENDLESS SERENADE / GIRL NEXT DOOR / MEIKING) and with character designs by Kimiduka Aoi (CAMPUS) comes I LOVE YOU, the story of one man, three sisters, and their longing for love! True love or just true lust? As one of the most handsome guys on campus, Jun has never had any trouble finding a girl who wants to have a good time, but while the sex is always hot, something just seems to be missing... love. Jun's search to find that special someone leads him to the Shinbashi sisters, his good childhood friends! Should he go for Reina, the gorgeous blonde who overflows with kindness? How about Lina, the perky and agile sports girl who's had a crush on Jun for years? And then thereâ€™s the mysterious Mina, the fiery redhead with a sharp tongue and a hot body who's just reappeared in his life... Three very different sisters, but all have the same needs and desires. Will Jun ever be able to pick just one?
