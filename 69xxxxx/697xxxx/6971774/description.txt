Nanda immediately denies the deal and leaves.In a week's daily routine Nanda feels something good and approvable idea of Arjun as the only problem in his life is his Wife. After a week's time his wife meets with an accident on the highway and dies on the spot. On the next day Arjun came to Nanda's home and depicts how he creates the accident and how he found out Indhu is unfaithful to Nanda by having a affair with her colleague named Gowtham. Arjun asks Nanda to complete the remaining part by murdering his dad and also explains he had a plan. Now onwards both of them meet frequently at locations where none can see them together and both of them are officially 
unconnected strangers to the world. Nanda explains he can't murder anyone. Arjun forces him by telling his dad is a evil human and only way for his happy life is to kill him.

Lavanya confused about what happened to Nanda and thought that he had gone mad. Arjun hears Lavanya telling about Nanda to her friend and threatens Nanda that he is still active and he can kill lavanya too. Nanda finally makes his decision and told arjun that he is ready for the murder of Devarajan. Arjun laid his plan and went to bangalore. Nanda
