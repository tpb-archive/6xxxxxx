In preparation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" movie, and also in the hope that a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Justice League\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" movie or something similar is thought of to be made, I present this collection of Live-Action DC Comics based movies.

Catwoman

Catwoman is a 2004 American superhero film and quasi-spinoff of the Batman film series directed by Pitof and released by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures on July 23, 2004.
The film was inspired by the DC Comics character of the same name, who is traditionally a supervillain and love interest of the superhero Batman.[2] This story features a completely new character, Patience Phillips, donning the Catwoman costume.
The film stars Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Lambert Wilson, Frances Conroy, and Alex Borstein. It was poorly received by critics and audiences and is commonly listed as one of the worst films ever made.

Batman Begins

Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero action film based on the fictional DC Comics character Batman, directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Christian Bale as Batman, along with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer. The film reboots the Batman film series, telling the origin story of the character and begins with Bruce Wayne\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, and his journey to becoming Batman. It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Long Halloween.
After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the 1997 critical failure of Batman & Robin, Nolan and David S. Goyer began work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film. The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The film, which was primarily shot in England and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniaturesâ€”computer-generated imagery was used minimally. A new Batmobile (called the Tumbler) and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film.
Batman Begins was both critically and commercially successful. The film opened on June 15, 2005 in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters. It grossed $48 million in its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $372 million worldwide. The film received an 85% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Critics noted that fear was a common theme throughout the film, and remarked that it had a darker tone compared to previous Batman films.
The film would begin Nolan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Batman trilogy; a sequel titled The Dark Knight was released in July 2008 and also saw the return of both Nolan and Bale to the franchise,[2] and a second sequel titled The Dark Knight Rises is scheduled for release in July 2012.

Superman Returns

Superman Returns is a 2006 superhero film directed by Bryan Singer. It is the fifth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as an alternate sequel to Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980)[2][3] by ignoring the events of Superman III (1983) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987).[2]
The film stars Brandon Routh as Superman, as well as Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, James Marsden, Frank Langella, and Parker Posey, and tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five year absence. He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme that will destroy the world, starting with the United States.
After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on the screen, Warner Bros. hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks; filming ended in November 2005. Preceded by an extensive marketing campaign at the cost of $44.5 million, Superman Returns was released to positive reviews and received many award nominations, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with the $391 million worldwide box office return. A sequel was planned for a summer 2009 release, but the project was later cancelled. The Superman series will be rebooted in 2013 with the film Man of Steel and will be directed by Zack Snyder with Henry Cavill as Superman.

The Dark Knight

The Dark Knight is a 2008 American superhero film directed, produced and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is part of Nolan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Batman film series and a sequel to 2005\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Batman Begins. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces the character of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s newly elected District Attorney and the cohort of Bruce Wayne\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who joins Batman and the police in combating the new rising threat of a criminal calling himself the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Joker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Heath Ledger).
Nolan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s inspiration for the film was the Joker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s comic book debut in 1940, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s origin. In addition elements of Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Dark Detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalised along with other elements of Batman mythology for the story.[4][5] The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. Nolan used an IMAX camera to film some sequences, including the Joker\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first appearance in the film. On January 22, 2008, some months after he had completed filming on The Dark Knight and six months before the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s release, Heath Ledger died from a toxic combination of prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public. Warner Bros. had initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign.[6][7]
The Dark Knight was released on July 16, 2008 in Australia, on July 18, 2008 in North America, and on July 24, 2008 in the United Kingdom. The film received highly positive reviews and set numerous records during its theatrical run.[8] With over $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it is the tenth highest-grossing film of all time (unadjusted for inflation).[9] The film received eight Academy Award nominations and won for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Ledger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s performance.[10] The film will be followed by a third and final entry titled The Dark Knight Rises, with Bale, Caine, Oldman and Freeman returning in the original roles. The film is set to be the conclusion of Christopher Nolan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Batman series.[11]

Watchmen

Watchmen is a 2009 American mystery superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and starring Malin Ã…kerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson. It is an adaptation of the comic book of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The film is set in an alternate history 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired vigilantes investigate an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more grandiose and sinister.
Following publication of the Watchmen comic, a live-action film adaptation was mired in development hell. Producer Lawrence Gordon began developing the project at 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. (parent company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics) with producer Joel Silver and director Terry Gilliam, the latter eventually deeming the complex novel \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"unfilmable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". During the 2000s (decade), Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce a script by David Hayter; Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass were also attached to the project before it was canceled over budget disputes. The project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct â€“ Paramount remained as international distributor. Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s failure to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios. Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s release with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. Principal photography began in Vancouver, September 2007. As with his previous film 300, Snyder closely modeled his storyboards on the comic, but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using chroma key and opted for more sets.
The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on March 6, 2009, grossing $55 million on the opening weekend, and grossed over $185 million at the worldwide box office. It divided film critics; some gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique take on the superhero genre, while others derided it for the same reason, as well as the R-rating, the running time, and the much-publicized accuracy to the graphic novel. A DVD based on elements of the Watchmen universe was released, including an animated adaptation of the comic Tales of the Black Freighter within the story, starring Gerard Butler, and the fictional biography[3] Under the Hood, detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s back-story. A director\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s cut with 24 minutes of additional footage was released in July 2009. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ultimate Cut\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" edition incorporated the Tales of the Black Freighter content into the narrative as it was in the original graphic novel, lengthening the runtime to 215 minutes, and was released on November 3, 2009.

Jonah Hex

Jonah Hex is a 2010 post-Civil War antihero Western film loosely based on the DC Comics character of the same name.[4] Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, the film is directed by Jimmy Hayward and stars Josh Brolin as the title character, Jonah Hex, and also stars John Malkovich, Michael Fassbender, and Megan Fox. The film was released on June 18, 2010.

Green Lantern

Green Lantern is a 2011 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The film stars Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins, with Martin Campbell directing a script by Greg Berlanti and comic book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim, which was subsequently rewritten by Michael Goldenberg.[5] Green Lantern tells the story of Hal Jordan, a test pilot who is selected to become the first human member of the Green Lantern Corps and given a ring that grants him superpowers after a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the universe.
The film first entered development in 1997 as a vehicle for writer/director Kevin Smith and went through various incarnations until Greg Berlanti was hired to write and direct in October 2007. Martin Campbell was brought on board in February 2009 after Berlanti was forced to vacate the director\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s position. Most of the live-action actors were cast between July 2009 and February 2010 and filming took place from March 2010 to August 2010 in Louisiana. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.
Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011. The film received generally unfavorable reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office according to analysts.
