Anxious to share this solitary life, his daughter, An, welcomes with joy the arrival of the female student. Soon their friendship develops into a sensual, but forbidden attraction. Incapable of separating themselves, Ming and An create a dangerous arrangement to be able to continue spending their lives together: Ming marries An's brother, who is a soldier and cannot bring his wife with him. However, An and Ming's relationship is discovered by the botanist who gets a heart attack when he finds out.
