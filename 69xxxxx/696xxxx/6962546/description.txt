David Wilkerson:



Reverend David Wilkerson was perhaps best known for his early days of ministry to young drug addicts and gang members in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. His story is told in The Cross and the Switchblade, a book he co-authored which became a best-seller. The story has been read by over 15 million people in some thirty languages since 1963. In 1969, a motion picture of the same title was released.

Reverend Wilkerson served as pastor in small churches in Scottsdale and Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, until he saw a photograph in Life magazine of several New York City teenagers charged with murder. Moved with compassion he was drawn to the city in February 1959. It was then that he began his street ministry to what one writer called "desperate, bewildered, addicted, often violent youth."

That same year, Reverend Wilkerson founded Teen Challenge ministries in Brooklyn, New York, which has reached youth and adults with life-controlling problems worldwide through its 414 centers. The ministry's biblically based recovery program for drug addicts has been recognized as one of the most effective efforts of its kind.

In 1967 he began David Wilkerson Youth Crusades, an evangelistic ministry characterized by Reverend Wilkerson's efforts to reach teenagers he called "goodniks" â€” middle-class kids who were restless and bored â€” to prevent them from being seduced into a life of bondage to drugs, alcohol, violence or lawlessness. Through this ministry, CURE Corps (Collegiate Urban Renewal Effort) was founded, in an effort to harness the idealism and sacrificial zeal of many Christian young people who knew about the Peace Corps and Vista but wanted to give their lives to Christ-centered efforts.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was tortured and Murdered for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures.

Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. With Repentance I Am Now forgiven for my sins past, present and Future.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
