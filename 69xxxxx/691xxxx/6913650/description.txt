From the author of the #1 International Bestseller "The Book of Awesome" and the award-winning, multimillion-hit website 1000awesomethings.com comes...
EVEN MORE of the little things that make us smile every day!

Neil Pasricha is back with a collection of hundreds more awesome things that deserve celebration including:
Coming back to your own bed after a long trip
Sneaking cheaper candy into the movie theater
Stepping on dry crunchy leaves on the sidewalk
Letting go of the gas pump perfectly so you end on a round number
When a baby falls asleep on you
Finally peeing after holding it forever
Pulling a weed and getting all the roots with it
Seeing old people holding hands
When your pet notices you're in a bad mood and comes to see you
When your windshield wipers match the beat of the song you're listening to
The smooth feeling on your teeth after you get your braces off
When the hiccups stop
Driving from a rough road onto a smooth one
Puppy breath
When the houseguest leaves
When the person you're meeting is even later than you are
Getting the keys to your first apartment
There's even space for you to write your very own Awesome Things in the back.

Because couldn't we all use (even more) AWESOME!?
