Although you MUST have the latest firmware (LT+1.91) or it will just reflash your DVD drive to original firmware and put a flag on it and you risk getting banned. 
If you have Slim you risk destroying your xbox if you don't have the latest firmware."

The game makes an update and stop at half.
It´s broke my XBOX. I can´t use more. "
,Powerslave0,2011-09-12T04:52Z,"For all you people that are having problems, it's because this contains the update for the new Disc Format, that flashes drives!  If you have a moded drive, it will fail, and you can lose use of the system. You have to flash back to STOCK, then update, then go back to CFW.  It is ALL your own stupid faults for not researching this stuff before doing it.  DO not blame the uploader, YOU are the dummies that knows nothing about the new update, and what it does.   If you flash back to ORIGINAL firmware, then the loop stops, then you go back to CFW. If you wanna be a PIRATE and steal this shit, then you suffer the consequences when you don't know what's going on in the scene."
,aznart,2011-09-12T09:47Z,"Ok dumbasses. If you brick your system, it's not the fault of the person uploading the game, got it? It's Microsoft's new method of cracking you guys down. If you have an older Firmware, this will cause issues. It's basically your damn fault for not reading that the flash for this torrent is for 1.9+, so don't blame those providing the ripped disc.

Now if you want to know how to bring your xbox back to life, here's how. Check out the link to flash your xbox with a USB flash drive and your xbox should be back to normal.

Problem is, it will be back to normal so you won't be playing backups until you flash to the lastest dash. 

Your welcome."

Game works perfectly, as long as you are on latest dash (13599) and latest c4eva FW. LT 1.91 or LT 1.92 for slims. And run through ABGX. All the idiots on old custom FW that are patching to Wave 3 etc deserve to have problems. Do it properly and your games will work and be safe online. Peace.


Its 100 % right . Im with 0225+ PCb + LT 1.91 and dash 13599 , I also patch the games wtih ABGX , always SSv2 and Im still in Live and I dont have any problems with any of mine 70 Xbox games . So stop bitching and take care of ur xbox first "
