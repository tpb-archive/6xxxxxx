A plane engine explodes. A plane goes down towards the ground. It looks like the end for the people aboard. But for some of them, it is a new beginning. Up in the air between Stockholm and Oslo, we follow seven people and a heart on its way from one body to another. All seven has something they are running from. When the heavy plane body is diving down towards the ground, they see life in another perspective.
