,jontexd,2011-09-21T01:56Z,I WILL SEED;)
,xgaryx,2011-09-21T02:00Z,"Thanks, will seed!"
,suslowim,2011-09-21T02:01Z,Con someone confirm if this works? This is my first time uploading a torrent on TPB.
,Ajs47951,2011-09-21T02:03Z,Seeding now
,Sivos,2011-09-21T02:06Z,"According to previous DLC, a patch was needed.  I hope the case is not with this verison (given there is no patch uploaded as of yet assuming this torrent is real), so we may not be able to play this until tomorrow.  I'm having internet trouble so it will take me 4 hours to download this with 1 seeder and 83+ leechers.  I will give my review tomorrow for I am tired and need my sleep.  As soon as it finishes downloading, I promise I will seed.  Upon I find this as a fake torrent, however, I will stop seeding.

All I can say now is download at your own risk.  If it is fake, it's a believable fake, lol."
,qklol,2011-09-21T02:07Z,Is this legit?
,Ajs47951,2011-09-21T02:08Z,nice upload
,Grentex,2011-09-21T02:10Z,As will I!
,Ajs47951,2011-09-21T02:12Z,dame comments are not working 
,KorriS,2011-09-21T02:17Z,Read or fake? THe filesize looks too small.
,Silent_Tofu,2011-09-21T02:19Z,you make my day
,TheXand,2011-09-21T02:22Z,"So is this legit then? Downloading now, will let people know."
,mosesmcdoodle,2011-09-21T02:24Z,probably fake. I doubt the last dlc to New Vegas is that small. Even compressed.
,Yodo223,2011-09-21T02:24Z,Shows that there are 13 comments... But where are they?
,KorriS,2011-09-21T02:25Z,"Ugh, comments are being retarded."
,VeteranD13,2011-09-21T02:35Z,Thanks a lot. Currently seeding 3:1.
,erock9894,2011-09-21T02:36Z,It Works!!!!!!!! :)
,jontexd,2011-09-21T02:37Z,Legit
,suslowim,2011-09-21T02:38Z,I got this from a trusted site and while I haven't played it yet (it's 2AM here) it's got all the files it should do. Uncompressed it's 750+MB.
,jontexd,2011-09-21T02:41Z,This is hardcore LEGIT!:D
,kh4920,2011-09-21T02:44Z,Thank you for upload this. :)

,jontexd,2011-09-21T02:47Z,damn comments
,jontexd,2011-09-21T02:50Z,RETAREDED COMMENT section
,Spengbab69,2011-09-21T02:53Z,"HonestHearts was 216 compressed, OldWorldBlues was 362 compressed, there's a good chance that 379 compressed is the real deal for LonesomeRoad."
,Grentex,2011-09-21T03:01Z,Legit Awsomeness
,lwhennen,2011-09-21T03:14Z,Good torrent thanks seeding now :)
,Arcannus,2011-09-21T03:17Z,"It's legit, 783 MB uncompressed."
,Theycallmewonka,2011-09-21T03:19Z,A comment
,TheXand,2011-09-21T03:27Z,"This is LEGIT, works perfectly. Major thanks to the uploader, there was another fake upload floating around that was pissing me off and then OP swooped in and saved the day, so cheers suslowim :P"
,AvalonSummit,2011-09-21T03:31Z,"Not too sure about this.. I'll just wait untill theres a trusted release, beter safe than sorry, they say."
,Sivos,2011-09-21T03:34Z,"Okay, I just finished downloading it and installing it, this is the real torrent.  This is NOT fake.  I have not played it yet because I'm really tired and it's not important enough to try it, lol (mainly that consists of finding the CD and moving these files to my gaming computer, lol).  However, I can confirm this torrent DOES include the Lonesome Road files, follow suslowim's installation instructions and you will be fine.  I'll be seeding all night so there will be at least someone seeding (just in case).

See you guys in the Divide :D!"
,Spengbab69,2011-09-21T03:34Z,"Definetly legit, thanks man. Will seed this for a few days."
,VeteranD13,2011-09-21T03:36Z,Works!! Thanks!!
,Sivos,2011-09-21T03:37Z,"Also, take note to those worried about the size, this is a DLC, they are always small.  The only way most of them are large is if they contain a patch that the DLC requires to play.  If you do not believe me, look at the other DLC's uploaded on this site, they are all small.  And if you don't believe that, look it up on Steam or Google it.  But you can trust me, this is the real deal."
,Sivos,2011-09-21T03:38Z,"And I didn't mean to say ""installing it,"" just really tired here, lol."
,amancebado,2011-09-21T03:43Z,Works fine for me. Thank you very much!
,innermp,2011-09-21T04:01Z,"AWesome it works!  Lol suslowim ur my hero man, been waiting all day for this"
,mosesmcdoodle,2011-09-21T05:15Z,"definitely legit, thanks for the upload and sorry for doubting you!"
,AvalonSummit,2011-09-21T05:32Z,"Guess I was wrong, torrents legit, thanks a lot uploader!"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-09-21T05:35Z,works as is
,Crimson13,2011-09-21T07:13Z,"It works for me. Just unzip, copy, and paste. Simple and easy."
,TheExPro,2011-09-21T07:56Z,"Lonesome Road - Main.bsa
Lonesome Road - Sound.bsa

That looks so fake >,,"
,darkmike7,2011-09-21T08:16Z,bot pod gets stuck is that normal?
,LuckyStrikeNor,2011-09-21T09:10Z,"This works! Haven't played trough it, but first few quests works fine. Nice job! Thanks!"
,Rentonek,2011-09-21T09:11Z,There is no update for it?
,klord2010,2011-09-21T10:12Z,"Ok, I can confirm it's legit. Thanks."
,DL900,2011-09-21T10:50Z,Thanks
,verimust,2011-09-21T11:00Z,is the dlc supposed to be accessed via the canyon wreckage? cos it's still blocked for me...
,Bizak,2011-09-21T11:48Z,"@verimust - you must first enable the packadge in the FalloutNVLauncher under Data Files - tick under [ ] LonesomeRoad.esm

Wait few sec while in-game and you will get a popup message. 

If you did not install the Upgrade 7 and try again."
,Pearlisius,2011-09-21T12:27Z,WTF IS THE PASSWORD TO UNLOCK THE RAR?! i press the línk in the read me folder and it leads me to a download site but i have to take 2345345 surveys to get the password -_-

,KidRapper,2011-09-21T15:23Z,Thanx a lot. It worked great!:)
,suslowim,2011-09-21T15:24Z,"The RAR has no password, this is the page for the genuine working version rather than the 3GB fake that's also on TPB."
,Spinefarm,2011-09-21T15:27Z,"It's the real thing. It works with no update needed. However, I crash when I enter The Divide. I have Skidrow update 7 and no other mods active except the DLC's. Anyone else having this problem?"
,VivaLaCebus,2011-09-21T16:16Z,no password i used this myself 
,Spinefarm,2011-09-21T16:28Z,"Nevermind I figured it out. 

I set the timescale to 1 via the console. It has to be set to default (30) or it crashes Lonesome road. "
,brianxxx,2011-09-21T16:59Z,"Just as a heads up to the FALLOUT fans like me - 
I would not play this DLC just yet. In 7 more days 2 MORE DLCs are coming - http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_add-ons#Gun_Runners.27_Arsenal

One is a repeat and consolidation of old stuff but the Gun Runner's Arsenal is going to have 27 new weapons and 40 new weapon mods and new challenges and achievements!!!

Now, why wait? Because the problem with Lonesome Road is that it is the LAST DLC with a mission and will NOT extend game play past the end of the story like Broken Steel did for FO3.

So, if you play this DLC, you will essentially have no reason - no enemies or missions to use the new weapons, etc. on unless you want to replay some old DLCs or restart the game.

This both pleases me (I like that they care to keep making DLC material) and pisses me off! Why the FUCK would you wait till the very end of production to release 27 new weapons??????!!!!!!

All that said...27 new wepaons and 40 new mods is incentive enough to make me want to repaly the game but who the fuck has all that time(unless you are still a kid or student with no real job or financial responsibilities) with RAGE, SKYRIM, ARKHAM CITY and many others being released between now and Xmas??? lol"
,Zetomb,2011-09-21T17:01Z,"Legit.

,axelstoner,2011-09-21T20:17Z,"got it working, 100% perfect"
,Sareth89,2011-09-22T01:02Z,"The dlc worked fine but after the first conversation with ulysses through ed-e (entering the divide and getting the first quest) i walk a little, the music stops and the game crashed.


IF anyone is having the same troube, use the falloutnvlauncher.exe and do the data files step again cuz i accidentaly press cancel instead of OK and i think thats why the game keep crashing, now it works fine 

Thanks for the upload"
,ZzCARLOSzZ,2011-09-22T01:50Z,"perfectly legit
but mine crashes when i try to go to the Hopeville Missile Base - West Entrance, anyone else have this prob?"
,Sareth89,2011-09-22T03:48Z,"Ok forget what i said in my previous post, the game crashed again, have to go back to the savefile where i first enter the divide and its crashing over and over and over everytime i tried to go down the hill after exiting the door.

Any help? already have all updates and previous DLC installed"
