Storyline

Based on the real-life events of Ian Fleming's 30 Commando during World War II - the inspiration for the SAS - this is a story which takes our heroes from the edge of defeat on the beaches of Dunkirk to the mountains of Norway on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines that, if successful, could change the course of the war.
