First of all, the director has started the film in a good old age sequence. The Bodhidharma, pallava culture, travel to Chinese land, Fight sequence in the china etc... was good. The hero could apt for 70% of the character(my suggestion of hero who is apt for the character is Kamal Hasan.Any ways he cant act though). Then the plot moves to Chennai where the decedent of Bodhidharma Dharma is now working in a circus- second Suriya. Sruthi hasan gets acquainted with him and those scenes are good indeed, but rather getting us away from the main theme. then hero comes to know about sruthi-suba who is a genetic engineering student and was following a ancient book script left by Bodhidharma dharma himself to excite the DNA to bring out hereditary skills or abilities. Dong lee - Johnny Nguyen a shaolin student, one of the best, who is hired by some Chinese goons to carryout an operation in India comes and tends to kill sruthi hasan and suriya. sruthi can bring the Bodhidharma dharma back to present by exciting Surya\'s DNA. so this was to be stopped by dong lee, if not his whole operation would be a failure, because the operation is a bio war, in which certain deadly virus is set out which happened in the period of bodhidharma(in china) and he is the one who cured it. so bringing him back would cure India of the virus again. so is Surya\'s DNA excited? did he turn to Bodhidharma dharma? did dong lee successfully complete his mission? Answers to this is the climax.

this film truly portrays the Tamilan\'s power and also strictly portrays their mind set which never accepts their ability....
