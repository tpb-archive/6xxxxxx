While its fearsome ancestor, the wolf, was created by natural selection-it is man that created the dog. This film explores the greatest inter-species friendship on Earth over the course of 40,000 years. Working closely with scientists, we deconstruct the genetic history of your favorite companion and explore how man has consistently re-engineered the dog to adapt to a changing world. An amazing story of how we have taken qualities we cherish from the wolf-loyalty, territory, protection and family-and bred them into a sweet, compliant animal that we call the dog.
