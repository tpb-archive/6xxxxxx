Plot: Months after Toy Story 3, it is winter break for Bonnie, who is going on vacation to Hawaii with her family for a week. The toys are excited to have a week of relaxation, but Barbie and Ken reveal themselves to have stowed away in Bonnies backpack, hoping to join her in Hawaii. Bonnie leaves them in her room, however, much to Kens horror when he realizes they are not going to Hawaii. Barbie reveals to Woody that Ken planned to have their first kiss on a beach at sunset (based on a travel brochure), inspiring Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Bonnies toys to go all out and recreate Hawaii for the two. After various adventures in Hawaii, Ken and Barbie share their first kiss in the snow at sunrise, recreating the scene from the brochure. However, the two step off the edge of the porch without realizing it and end up buried in snow; a post-credits scene shows the other toys trying to free them from a block of ice in which they are now frozen.
