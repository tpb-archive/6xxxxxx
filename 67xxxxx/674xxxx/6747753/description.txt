All are unabridged and recorded at 48kbps Mono CBR MP3. 

My friend Shauna kindly provided books 1 to 5 from cassette tapes (no CD's available yet) and I provided books 6 to 8 from CD's. 

 
I previously posted these titles individually here over a year ago and have had frequent requests to seed, so I decided to bundle all eight titles and upload them this time as a complete set. Note that some of these recordings are from cassette tapes that are in some cases quite old, thus the sound quality may be a bit dull, but they are reasonably hiss free and clear.(This well written modern cozy English murder mystery series is a favorite of mine.)

#1. Pray and Die [2000], Cassette, 8 hours 37 mins, read by Ann Cator 
Someone has to investigate the mean streets of Latching, West Sussex - and that someone is Jordan Lacey, ex-policewoman, now advertising her services as a private investigator in the local paper and working out of a junk shop in the quiet part of town. Will there be enough crime in the sleepy streets of Latching to keep her in business? It looks like there is. Ursula Carling is convinced that her husband is having an affair and employs Jordan to track down the mistress who is sending hate mail. But Ursula isn't telling Jordan everything: for example, her husband died eighteen months ago. Then Jordan discovers the body of a dead nun in an abandoned hotel, along with clues to a hidden World War Two fortune, clues which somehow connect to Ursula Carling. But when she tries to notify the police, in the shape of the devastatingly attractive DI James, she finds herself accused of crying wolf. Not even the slice of poisoned carrot cake she mysteriously received is enough to change his mind. Perhaps it will take an altogether more dramatic attempt on Jordan's life to make DI James sit up and take notice.

#2. Wave and Die [2001], Cassette, 8 hours 35 mins, read by Julia Franklin
In the sequel to Pray and Die, off-the-wall private investigator Jordan Lacey has progressed to cases of an entirely different class: from missing tortoises to stolen water lilies and vandalism at the Women's institute. But Sussex wives will be careless with their husbands, and soon enough Jordan is on the trail of another missing spouse. Complications arise when the husband in question is found dead in a burning showroom, and his 'wife' turns out not to be married to him. Then Jordan is accused of the arson attack at the scane of the crime and really starts to wonder whether sleuthing is her true vocation. There's a silver lining to every cloud, however, now that Jordan's in this deep, she doesn't have to via for the attention of dishy DI James, since he's hounding her...

Jordan Lacey, Latching's intrepid and unconventional P.I., has two new cases to solve: a paternity dispute and a weird cross-dressing mystery. Neither case is as simple as it seems and during her roller-coaster investigations, she unearths more than she expects. She becomes entangled in a ten-year-old unsolved murder and it doesn't help when she is held hostage by a bull mastiff, engulfed by a freak tidal wave and poisoned by some suspicious parsley. Her own emotional dramas escalate when Detective Sergeant Ben Evans talks her into a holiday and Detective Inspector James, the object of her unrequited love, has a fit of old-fashioned jealousy.

#5. Jest and Die [2004], Cassette, 7 hours 46 mins, read by Ann Cator

Her other case - protecting George Hill, a handsome stand-up comedian, from a female stalker - is fraught with a different danger. When Jordan accidentally unearths an international crime racket, her hero, Dl James demands that she goes into hiding. But Jordan has no intention of taking orders from him or of giving up her cases. However, fate deals a cruel blow and Jordan is left to pick up the pieces and somehow solve what has now become a personal vendetta.

Jordan Lacy, Latching's zany private eye, is thrown in the deep end - literally - when fishing rods start disappearing from the pier. Next, stolen pedigree puppies start adding to her case load. But it all gets more serious when one of the anglers is found hanging in the bell tower of a church, his past life shrouded in mystery. Then a cache of diamonds go missing from a raided security box and a revengeful gang member is determined to find out where they are hidden.

And when the love of her life, DI James, announces his transfer to Yorkshire, she knows she will have to claw her way back to sanity.

When Jordan's life is threatened on three separate occasions, she realises that she may, for once, be on the right track. Her usual flare for surveillance gear has her impersonating an insurance agent, ghost hunter and a foreign day tripper.
