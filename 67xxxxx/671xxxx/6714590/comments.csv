,segamon,2011-10-01T19:17Z,thank you.
,babbleM,2011-10-01T19:31Z,"remember people! THIS IS AN XGD3 ISO AND WILL ONLY BE PLAYABLE WHEN LT2.0 IS RELEASED!!!

thanks for the upload i've been waiting for this since the midnight that it was released. i hear LT2.0 is coming this month?"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-01T20:11Z,"LT2.0 is due for release soon, this game was ripped using the new 0800 firmware which also means that it will compress onto a single dual layer dvd and can be burned using imgburn."
,Robstar360,2011-10-01T20:19Z,Is there any difference between this upload and this one? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6692944/Gears_Of_War_3_%5BEnglish%5D_%5BRegion_Free%5D
[V],boobsman,2011-10-01T20:31Z,"Don't know mate i've not downloaded that version but if its not been ripped with 0800 it probably wont work. This is the RROD 0800 rip and its been tested and verified with abgx360, i've not played it myself as LT2.0 is not out yet but this is the best scene rip available."
,hootieman,2011-10-01T20:59Z,"Dom dies, happy playing"
,alex22408,2011-10-01T21:07Z,"how do we know if they (ISOS) are ""0800 rip"" someone help im like confused one everything now.i thought it was gna be same thing weve always done before where we just download ISo run it through ABGX and burn but now im confused. i Know we will have to download the newer ABGX that is compatible with LTv2.0 and the img burn erroes will pop up but i dnt get what and how we will know that the ISOS are ""0800 firmware/rip"". so can someone help ,thanks"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-01T21:43Z,"You need to check on the abgx website to see if the version your downloading has been verified and if from a recognized ripper, this is the RROD rip and is 0800. The game needs to be 0800 ripped so that it can fit on a single dual layer, the game nfo contains instructions of how to set up and burn this game so stop worrying!"
,noli1991,2011-10-01T22:34Z,Hi Guys i was wondering does this game work with the firmwire lt +1.91 or not?
,MitchJJ_NL,2011-10-01T22:54Z,"No, wait for the 2.0 release."
[V],boobsman,2011-10-01T23:04Z,"No this game will not work on LT1.9 as it does not support the XGD3 disc format, you need to wait until LT2.0 is released and update your drive firmware."
,butrus_,2011-10-01T23:44Z,"anyone that can tell me why it will not work on older fm??
what happens if i burn it,and trys to play it??"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T00:23Z,"Older firmware does not support the new XGD3 disc format, you can burn the game if you want the nfo contains instructions for setting up imgburn so it works with the new format only don't be surprised when it doesn't work. Also pleade remember that the disc contains the latest firmware update that flashes consoles so if your not already updated your drive will probably be flashed back to stock and your console will lock!"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T01:45Z,"Not tried dvd decrypter mate but the nfo file contained in these files give instructions on how to set up imgburn, there should be no reason why you couldn't use that info to set up dvd decryter in the same way, the worst that will happen is that the disc will fail to burn correctly."
,TGOD_ROB,2011-10-02T04:21Z,Say Mate u gonna have Rage next pls have mate 
,TGOD_ROB,2011-10-02T04:27Z,@Hottieman Bitch dont ever tell what happens in ah game do it again and im gonna knock your shit out 
,lokolokomo,2011-10-02T05:44Z,83JB use vso copytodvd to burn your xbox backup.I've been using it for many years.
,angelwiki,2011-10-02T06:58Z,Guys what does exactly mean by - 0800 rip ? from what i have been hearing it is now possible to burn this game !  is that what it means ? 
,enigma717,2011-10-02T09:45Z,"thanks uploader, keep ip the good work, wite upcoming games ;-)"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T10:41Z,"0800 is the software that's needed to rip the xgd3 games, if there not done correctly it wont work with the LT2.0 firmware that's coming out, all you need to know is that if the game is xgd3 it needs to be 0800 as well."
,segunfms,2011-10-02T13:39Z,i have a new xbox 360 i just bought and i want to know maybe this game will work on it without chipping my xbox 360. thanks. 
,hunta8827,2011-10-02T13:51Z,Can I play online if my console has that LT thing?
,frozt27,2011-10-02T16:12Z,hey can anyone download a video on how to flash your xbox 360 i have a liteon elite but dont know what programs i need or how to download them and dont know all the tool the i need so if you can download a video showing how to do it step by step from the opening of a xbox to the end thanks PS: i already try youtube dint work not enogth details 
,SteelerJ17,2011-10-02T16:12Z,This is the message I got from abgx360: ERROR C:\Xbox360Games360\Gears of War 3\rrod gow 3 iso. isn't recognized as an XBOX 360 ISO or Stealth File! Does this mean that there's going to be new update of the abgx360?
,angelwiki,2011-10-02T17:10Z,"@Boobsman 
annnddd than there comes You :D , pretty much i can guess that your torrents always gonna be 0800 ripped :) like this one - Thumbs up = "
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T17:20Z,"@ SteelerJ17, your copy of abgx360 will not verify this game as its not been updated for the xgd3 game format, you need to wait for the update release before abgx will work with any of the new xgd3 0800 releases."
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T17:32Z,"@ angelwiki, no point in posting none 0800 rips as they probably wont work."
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T18:46Z,"@ hunta8827, you need LT2.0 to run this game but its not been released yet so you'll have to wait."
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T18:48Z,"@ segunfms, you need to mod your console before you can play back up games, you google to look up xbox360 flashing."
,hunta8827,2011-10-02T22:10Z,@boobsman I was asking whether I can play on xbox live with that LT software safely or not :)
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T22:37Z,"@ hunta8827, it not clear if you'll be able to play online and not get caught. To burn the new xgd3 games you need to miss off some of the data from the disc and its not clear if this will flag you when you go online but until LT2.0 is released there's no way on knowing. "
,micko84,2011-10-03T00:16Z,just flashed my drive with 2.0 and can say that the game works 100%
,BLTW777,2011-10-03T00:25Z,"@boobsman, if I don't go live at all and just want to play single player story, are there any dangers in playing this game? I think you mentioned something about the disc reflashing the console and locking it up. Thanks."
,mrnexus,2011-10-03T00:26Z,"@hottieman/yeah i know ive come here to get a back-up of my £40 gears3 copy which m$ wont allow me do to because they dont give a fuck if u get it scratched and have to buy another, so you know what you slimy little creep fuck off with ur spoilers, Twat."
,fanfasnight,2011-10-03T00:28Z,Micko84 can you use it online? Wich program you used to burn the game ? Ty

,micko84,2011-10-04T01:06Z,"Step by Step:

ensure that underTools > Settings > Write, you have ""Layer Break (For DL Media)"" setto ""Calculate Optimal""

space on the disc to burn the image, and asks if you would like to

,MastaWayne23,2011-10-04T13:12Z,"the burning process didnt work twice for me, it actually stopped at 48%, i did as instructed by @superTsubasa to the letter"
,jimsmithno1,2011-10-04T14:36Z,iv tried it 3 times as well and it stops at around 48 percent and iv done everything right 
,jimsmithno1,2011-10-04T14:45Z,im having the same problem as well stops at 48 percent and says the problem is invalid address for writen and iv done it right 
,jimsmithno1,2011-10-04T14:47Z,im having the same problem it stops at 48 percent and it says on the imgburn log invalid write address and i know i done it right 
,Linkmrr,2011-10-04T15:55Z,"Working for me. Have to eject/close/eject/close MULTIPLE TIMES though, but have had past 360s that did that stock. Havent hooked to live with it waiting for new abgx burn with imgburn and click yes/continue and at the end around 98% something will popup hit cancel then ask if you want to run """" click yes. your done. just better have lt+ 2.0"
,Linkmrr,2011-10-04T15:58Z,and make sure you update new layer break or check the .dvd it needs to be 2 something for xgd3 19something for previous games
,Revolver31,2011-10-04T16:10Z,"again SuperTsubasa and micko84 are correct thats what i done and have had no probs the only thing i can think of is first make sure its set to  calculate optimal in the settings very important also check the iso info (same window you select the iso file) b4 you burn. the layer break on the iso info should be 2133520 then continue with the rest of the instructions you could also try burning with another drive ive herd there MAYBE? problems with some.
 oh get the new imgburn just released today 2.5.6.0"
,jimsmithno1,2011-10-04T16:57Z,well i just went and downloaded the new imgburn and tried it on my dads laptop and it burned it and it seems to be working all you have to do is follow the other instructions click write then choose overburn it worked for me thank god lol 
,SuperTsubasa,2011-10-04T21:20Z,"another detail just to make sure is to create a .dvd if this rip dosent come with one.

open notepad on start and type: 

LayerBreak=2133520
""iso name"".iso

making sure the iso name is the same as .iso without the "" "" , now save the notepad again with the same name as the iso but in the end add .dvd (we dont want a text file but a .dvd file) to change the extension.Thats only need if a game (ISO) dont come with one and ALWAYS check the infos on the .dvd that come with games because ive come with incorrect iso name on the .dvd files some times and that messes with the game.

hope it helps"
,VexxedMe,2011-10-04T22:12Z,"Updated my LiteOn to LT 2.0 today, followed the same process that SuperTsubasa has kindly shared and it all works fine. For others updating firmware, ensure you have the most recent update before re-flashing."

,SuperTsubasa,2011-10-05T16:54Z,"How to burn your XGD3 backup (IMGBURN) (NEW VERSION) *No Errors*

Get Imgburn 2.5.6.0 
XGD3 backups must be made with latest version of XBC and 0800 v3.
First ensure you run the latest ImgBurn (2.5.6.0 was the time of writing)

Now go to Tools > Settings

Go to Write tab and ensure Layer Break is set to Calculate Optimal

So on the startup screen again, press Write image file to disc

Choose your .dvd file in source and press Write

Youâ€™ll get a message, choose Truncate

After a whileâ€¦.
the burning is completed.

Thatâ€™s it!

Abgx dosent support xgd3 yet so dont try it online,the back to dash problem may be a jumped 

detail or faulty FW on even a bad drive, no details yet.Every xgd3 will only play if flashed 

with LT2.0 and always burn at 2.4x speed."

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN

       We recommended that you use the latest version of ImgBurn (v2.5.5.0
       at the time of writing, downloadable at
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download). Older versions may
       handle this process differently and/or give a different set of
       errors.

       Although it is set by default in ImgBurn, please ensure that under
       Tools > Settings > Write, you have ""Layer Break (For DL Media)"" set
       to ""Calculate Optimal"".

       Please ensure that the layerbreak is set as 2133520 in the .dvd file.
       If you already have the XGD2 (or other) layerbreak value set in
       ImgBurn, the .dvd of the XGD3 ISO will override that setting and use
       the proper layerbreak.

       As mentioned above, ImgBurn will automatically reposition/limit the
       layerbreak to 2086912 when burning to regular DVD+R DL discs.

       Please see the included imgburn-xgd3-errors.png image for screenshots
       of the errors you'll encounter in ImgBurn and what to click on in
       each dialog that pops up.

       Step by Step:

       1. Choose ""Write image file to disc"", and after loading the .dvd
       file, click ""Write"".

       2. ImgBurn will pop up a notice saying that there is not enough
       space on the disc to burn the image, and asks if you would like to
       continue anyway. Click ""Yes"".

       3. Another message might pop up saying that optimal layerbreak
       position exceeds L0 capacity. Click ""Yes"".

       4. An error will then pop up noting that ""Set L0 Data Zone
       Capacity Failed"". Click ""Continue"".

       5. The image will begin writing to the disc.

       6. Nearing the end of the write process, ImgBurn will pop up an
       error at around 97% or 98% (this is what we want -- it's
       intentional!). Click ""Cancel"".

       7. A notice will then pop up asking if you would like ImgBurn to
       try and perform the ""'Close Track/Session/Disc' functions"". Click
       ""Yes"".

       8. Let the disc finalize, and you're done!"

I have Fifa 12 that works fine on the flash update and so do all my other backups. I have tried burning this using clone CD and the newest version of Image burn without success. I have entered the correct layer breaks on the DVD file and I am confident the issue is not with any of my burners as they have been backing up games for years.

I have a Pioneer 212bdk, LG bluray burner and I have bought a samsung bluray burner today just to make sure. I am using Verbatim discs in case it was the media code and although the dashboard says play game, when I click play game the screen goes black and then goes back to the dashboard.

I have cleared system cache and I have just burned rage that was ripped using 0800v3 and guess what it worked.

I thought I would share this, my 360 is running 2.0 firmware with the latest dashboard. I followed the instructions supplied on this page/in the NFO for this torrent. I burnt the game using ImgBurn (brand new version) using Verbatim DL discs (layer break was correct too) and the game would freeze 10 minutes into the game, I burnt it again, same problem, I tried installing to HDD from either disc and they would both fail.
SO, I burnt using CloneCD, same image, same dvd file, same verbatim media, same burn speed, and the game worked perfectly, doesn't freeze and WILL install to the HDD.
WORKING PERFECTLY
If your game isn't working, try burning with the latest version of CLONECD!"

10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated with LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT 1.9) DASHBOARD: 20135990

DOWNLOAD THE 87 FILES OF THIS GAME. THEN EXTRACKTING THE RAR-FILES INTO 1 ISO GAME FILE, AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE OF THE GAME TO PUT 2GETER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. 


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3.  Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile (37 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now say: \rrod-gow3.dvd

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now ask if U would like to burn the game that is 8.7 GB on u 8.5 GB disc.
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successful! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install the finished burnt 7.5 GB game to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. The Intro comes, 
but then it all goes black screen? Turn OFF your xbox360, and start the game from the begining again and then it works PERFECTLY!!!

,coxdre123,2011-10-26T05:31Z,Need some help guys! I burned my game correctly with IMGburn. When I stick my game in my xbox it says play game and resets back to the dashboard. I have flashed my xbox to LT 2.0. When I first put in my GOW3 it said my xbox needed an update before I could play the game. I did the update. Is that my problem? I currently am running dashboard 13604. Any help would be great. I really want to play this game.
,mrnexus,2011-10-26T11:24Z,"@coxdre123/never i mean never update on a dashboard before retutning  the drive to stock that means as u know putting in your dummy.bin file going back to stock then update via usb.cd/or xboxlive i update myself via usb,then after that reflash it,it does'nt take long,to see if ur console is banned download xval 2.0 console ban info-just goggle it or go to utube etc,ive only learned to flash my drive a week ago so my knowledge is limited,but i do know to never update without flashing back to stock which means opening up ur console taking out the drive hooking it up to jungleflasher with  i use the x360usbpro and the ck3i and flash back to stock do the update then reflash,takes about an hour but keeps u safe,i wish i could help u more m8,but thats all i know at the present."
,dolphane,2011-10-28T19:30Z,"heres my last question, i have an old hitachi drive, 47d or whatever, and it never has had to worry about ap 2.5 or anything else like that because its too old to read it, but ive always patched with abgx....do i really even need to do that? should i keep waiting for the release of its ability to handle these xgd3 games when it probably wont matter to my xbox anyways, and if not my question is why doesnt everybody just sell their newer xbox and buy one of these used old ones?"
,gymrat780,2011-10-29T04:38Z,"Works great. I have LT 2.0. Doesn't work in Abx360. I burned using IMG Burn 2.56, and selected use whole disk (or whatever the option to write when the game has more space than the disc)."

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:20Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
,daviddomingues,2011-11-30T00:59Z,"i have an issue i wasted two of my DVD DL discs tying to burn (Boobsman's) gears of war 3, a XGD3. I did all the steps, i choose yes to the advise about the game being bigger than the disc, but there was no error at the end of the process like it should happen. sometimes my xbox 360 recognises the game but then when i press play it gos to the dashboard again and says that the disc couldnt be read. i use verbatim DVD+R DL !!!!
 why cant i burn tem correctly?"

its ok man dont worry ,
for some reason it will not work by installing it to hard drive because :
-u have LT 3 
-this game is not full rip (8.7 GiB)
-and u should burn the full rip via iIHAS burner.
so if u burnet with another burners and /or its not full rip of the game, it will gave u that error when  u install it.
so to resolve this error ,u just need to remove the game u installed and play it directly from the dvd it will work perfectly ,
i know u dont want to stress the lenss but curently there is no solution for that problem except this.

hope i helped : )"

,baconbriefs,2012-04-08T22:48Z,Don't listen to the morons who say that you need 3.0 to play this. This was ripped before LT 3.0 came out so it works with LT 2.0. Tried and tested myself.
