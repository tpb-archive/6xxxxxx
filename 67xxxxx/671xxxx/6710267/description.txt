Despite having his sword sealed by the web, Rin insists to go after the masked one but is held back by Yukio and Shura, until he gets word that his friends, Suguro, Renzo and Konekomaru are being attacked too and rushes to help them. Before being able to intervene, Mephisto Pheles is taken away by representatives of the high order who suspect him of directing unauthorized biological research.

Uploader Notes:
===============
                  The size of the files are very small and anyone will surely think that this is very bad quality. Well, it is not. Speedy Joe's files are all 'mp4' format and so the videos are good even in small files. If you ask me, I would give this a rating of 10 in Audio and 8 in Video. For best results, use VLC Player.
