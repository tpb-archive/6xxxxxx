,CinderzFTW,2011-09-28T12:15Z,"Right, for all you n00bs out there.

1. Download (ofc)
2. Mount or burn using Daemon Tools or Magic ISO
3. Install (No Keygen Required)
4. Copy over cracked content to installation file
5. Play the game.

No key is needed for this game. Easy to install and great from Extremezone and Reloaded as usual.

Just make sure you have a decent dual core processor, at least 2gb ddr2 memory and decent graphics card of 8800gt or more to get best results from the game. I run Quad @ 3.4, 4gb ddr3 and hd5770 and works flawlessly @ 1920*1080 via hdmi cable using 24"" monitor.

Great Torrent!

Thanks for the tip...but that didnt work for me either.
When using that method, then 2 triggers of the gamepad stop working and for some reason i cant select some options or teams, for example the entire spain league doesnt appear when you select your default team, or i can only select between 2 buttons or classic controler.

guys, for those its not working, make sure that you downloaded the same torrent. All the issues like password for crack, activation key comes on the other RELOADED torrent which is not good..

Steps done by me.

1. Mount the iso using deamon tools.
2. Install the game.
3. Download the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6705396/ torrent which is the crack.
4. Replace the fifa.exe from the crack into the installation directory.
5. Play the game.."
,bjorg18,2011-09-29T06:10Z,"just finished downloading and installed the game.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL INSTALLING THE GAME.

I installed the realoaded version last night, played through the night.
After a while i got really bored with the 800Ã—600 setting, and quit the game to enter 1080p.
After i changed the fifaconfig.exe, all i got on startup was crashdump CL942004 :)
Iâ€™ve been looking for fixes, but none has worked.
Iâ€™ve tried changing and replacing the replay0.bin file and iâ€™ve tried changing the fifasetup_deafult.ini file. Iâ€™ve also tried every kind of res and setting on the fifaconfing.exe, iâ€™ve tried every kind of compability setting, running as administrator and so on. Iâ€™ve blocked both FIFA|12.exe and origin.exe in firewall.
Does anyone know how to fix this?
Iâ€™m running win7 64-bit.

As i said, the game worked perfectly fine untill i changed the settings!"

1) Open rld-fi12.iso with Daemon Tools, if you have'nt it download it from the Daemon Tools website.

2)In the .iso file there is another file named Crack, so click on it and copy the crack and paste it into the fifa12 gamefolder.

3)Than you can play the game. if you're antivirus is asking for a kind of permission, just ignore it. Click back on the game-icon and play.

It's so simple."

Are you sure you've cracked the game properly? You take the fifa.exe file from the 'crack' folder (should be 21.9mb in size) and place it in 'EA Sports\FIFA12\Game' folder. It should replace the original fifa.exe (which, IIRC, is about 40mb). "

,guybhoy,2011-10-01T01:24Z,"For people having the problem with Origin etc I wish you would read through the 20 pages of comments first before posting the same questions over and over.

The answer is relatively simple. Disconnect from internet, install game via daemon tools or similar programme, copy over the crack and then make sure your firewall is set to block FIFA from accessing internet.

Run the game and any pop ups from firewall asking to access internet say no and keep blocking.

You WILL NOT be able to play online so STOP asking!

For those with questions regarding settings. Jeez again simple there will be a folder under Program files > FIFA 12 > Game > fifa setup > fifaconfig.exe if thats too difficult just search fifaconfig in windows!

Here you will be able to change the resolution and graphical detail to low for those who think they have a top of the range machine bought 5 years ago and the torrent doesn't work cos it keeps crashing!

Hope this solves most ppl's problems and the tone of this reply wasn't too patronising. (If it doesn't please read through the previous 20 pages of comments mostly from noobs or people too retarded or lazy to do so.)

extremezone thanks!!"

Try activating your guest account and rename your doccuments folder to ""mydoccuments"" and then run fifa 12 from the guest account. Everything should work ok.  Including saves.

,hiperx,2011-10-01T23:04Z,"for everyone that is unable to save, the solution, like someone said here, is to go to the guest account, and play the game there. Most of you probably don't have it active, just activate it by going to: control panel->User accounts->User accounts->Manage accounts->Change guest account options. You need to have the replay0.bin with the ""read only"" NOT ticked and execute fifa.exe as administrator.
Go to guest account and good play! :D"

after installing the game u 'll find redistributables folder or installer folder where u have installed fifa.

The only solution is that someone tells me how to change the savegame location of the Fifa game, i.e set as savefolder lets say C:/Fifa12 so that it wont matter if the ""My Documents"" are in english or in other language.

,MicVR,2011-12-19T16:34Z,"I love the piratebay for giving us a platform on which we can try videogames before buying them. This game has been on my pc for about 12 minutes before I got so utterly frustrated with it that I kicked it off.

The game looks great. Seems promising. But it has a rediculously dense game menu structure with menu options that give you absolutely no clue on what it will do. Just hire some human factors engineers to sort that out EA. Mostly the trouble is in controls. After some try and error for 5 mins I googled how to change controls. But then still you simply have to guess what button does what and again the words give no clue what action the button will try to make happen.

I actually made a profile to comment on this screw up of a game... what a waste of code and fifa lisence. If you like video games play ANYTHING else. If you like soccer, dont try this.

p.s.
I played Fifa 99 till my fingers went numb."

1) unrar using winrar.
2) Mount the image using demon tools
3) go to your computer and where you normall dvd drives etc are there should be a fifa12 icon double click and the game should take you through the install process. (follow this as you would normally)
4) go to where the folder that you unrared to and go to the (crack) folder, inside of that is another icon, copy this icon and paste it into (programme files/ fifa12 / game) this will ask if you want to replace the current folder click yes.
5) now either click the icon that you just pasted or click the icon that has appeared on your desktop.

PS if you are having problems with the download:
--------------------------------------------
IT       IS       ON       YOUR       END!

Google stuff, read things and read some more, You'll figure it out. Try the Bay forums if you're really having problems. 
Bottom line though? The download is legit and working. Period.

Thanks again extremezone
