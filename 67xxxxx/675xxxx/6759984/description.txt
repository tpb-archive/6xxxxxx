The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-third alphabetical installment is: DC from Str-Supera

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================


Some changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 12 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman. The Superman torrent will be around 43-45gb, depending on how many replacement scans are in the folder now. I think it's a lot. I will not rush part 46, so as to give you all time to download.

Sizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.

44 Superb-Swd (-Superman)  15gb
45 Superman                45gb
46 Swe-Td                  14gb

The DC TPB reprint of some of The Strontium Dog stories is unscanned,  So here's a lot more of him as a substitute and more.

Haven't read it and I have no idea what the title is about. Is it a man nicknamed "dog", and for some reason also called strontium? I have no idea. Is it a dog who likes to sniff out strontium ore? I could find out in  a moment but I'd rather go off on a tangent It's nearly inevitable that I will. "Resistance is futile". It is.. my destiny. "Destiny, Destiny, No escaping not for me!

Strontium,  as every right thinking, God fearing, upstanding citizen of wherever you personally live knows, is an element. It is a silvery metal, soft and quite chemically active. In powdered form it oxidizes so rapidly it can burst in to flame  - this is what you call "extreme rusting". It combines easily with  water too. So not going to be found in pure from in your back yard. If you have some though, it's valuable.

If the strontium dog here was a statue of a dog made of pure strontium - what would it be worth? Of course we must be more specific than "dog", Well since it's a UK comic we'll take a 25kg English Bull Dog as our model.  That is obviously the breed that's most appropriate here symbolically. You can't get more appropriate than that. Apologies to the Scottish, Welsh and Irish in the UK, but  no West Highland Terriers, Scotch Terriers, Rough Collies,  Irish Wolfhounds, Irish Setters, Irish Spaniels, Welsh Corgies, Welsh Terriers, or Welsh Springer Spaniels need apply. 

So  based on probably out of date and unreliable figures, our 25kg (55lb) English Bulldog statue of pure strontium is worth about $25,000 dollars, plus any value as an art object.
Not too shabby!

I know you were all as eager to know that as I was. Surely your minds are curious about everything in the universe like mine is? In my head, I know that's probably not true of many of you, but I can't wrap my head around it.  Which is a very odd idiom to use in this case. In my heart I know it's true. I have a gut feeling about it.  I feel it in my bones. Deep in my soul, in my bowels, in the very fiber of my being. This would have been killer if I could have  figured out how to work "spleen" in here. Darn! I really am upset about it. I really just need to vent my spleen about this. Well lookie there!

Some people actually dress up in costume and run around as small time vigilantes or just as helpful people doing good deeds. There are maybe a dozen or so scattered around the US. I have not heard of anyone doing this as a crook. Sure, there are robbers who have worn costumes as a disguise while robbing a store. For some reason they were not content with the just a mask. But these were just one-offs, not an attempt to create a persona. They don't make new custom Super-Villian costumes and make up Super-Villian names. This might be because this would be an incredibly stupid thing to do. The last thing a criminal should want to do is attract extra attention and tie themselves to additional crimes by wearing a signature costume. Even the one offs are idiots, since they are far more noticeable arriving and departing.  But if you know of a case of super-villany I'd love to hear about it. Real criminals are not nearly as entertaining as they could be.

What could be better than super gorillas? Superman, Batman and the Flash in un-related stories. Back in the 50s and early 60s there was quite a fascination with gorillas in the comics world. There are some pretty funny covers out there with gorillas on them.
