Five interwoven stories that occur on the same block, on the same night. A couple finds what happens when they blow a jack o\' lantern out before midnight, a high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer, a college virgin might have met the right guy for her, a group of mean teens play a prank that they take too far, and a hermit is visited by a special trick or treater.
