,dwatson,2011-10-25T03:00Z,"@zuriki, just open daemon tools lite once you've downloaded and installed it, if it looks like it hasn't opened immediately, check your notifications area at the bottom right of your desktop for the little lightening logo, click that, then right click in the bottom box of daemon tools and click 'add new scsi drive"" and it will make you a new virtual drive, which you can now use to ""mount"" (play) .iso files/images. double clicking on the .iso should automatically mount it in daemon tools but if it doesn't, you can add it manually by clicking the ""add file"" button and navigating to the .iso.
I feel I must also include the words ""fucking noob faggot"", just to fit in with the rest of the insolent bastards that frequent these boards!!
enjoy BF3 when you eventually get it:)
I shagged your mum."
,Ezel,2011-10-25T05:10Z,"If the game doesn't start and you think you've done everything right, try to REMOVE THE (TM)-CHAR FROM THE INSTALLDIRECTORY that is created.

Unfortunately for me it crashes later when I try to start a campaign. Still no BF3-action for me :-("

,Lightfigter,2011-10-26T15:02Z,"It's not working 4 me, i'm used to these kind cracks. Have installed al redists from _installer

Have a Win 7 (64), with Ati R5850 and latest drivers.

If i start bf3.exe (from crk dir) i get an error directly"
,tonym2112,2011-10-26T17:33Z,"ok...this is the hardest reloaded install I've ever done!
I'm fairly new too this so here's some instructions my 3 year old can follow.
1 open daemon tools and click ""add dt virtual drive"" now you should have 2 virtual drives.
2 drag and drop both ISO files into daemon tools
3 mount each ISO into seperate virtual drives (don't use autorun) and open disc 1
open game folder and right click ""gamefiles01"" click run as admin
4 choose a file location like C:programfiles (x86)BF3
once all 34 files have extracted a window will pop up asking for file 35
click ""browse"" and open disc 2.
open ""game"" file and then click ""OK""
after all 58 files are done extracting re-open disc 2 and open ""crack"" file
copy bf3 app file and paste it in the C:programfiles (x86)BF3 folder you created earlier
5 right click bf3 and run as admin to start game
this game has a long load time, but if your screen flashes let the game load and when you get to where you can change options go to VIDEO and change FULLSCREEN to NO.
This worked for me after uninstalling and reinstalling FOUR times. LOL
Hope this helps, and quit crying about seeding when you probably hit and run, you selfish dolts.
Thanks to all the upload and crack teams. You guys rule.   GOD LOVES A PIRATE!!!"

,omar1131,2011-10-27T07:08Z,"well for anyone suffering problems playing, try this

Uninstall each and every software from windows
Delete any viruses from the entire HardDisk with avg/avast and super antivirus
Delete windows 7 ,and do a 100% fresh install of the 64 bit ver(if possible)
Don't install anything yet,
Download the latest drivers of motherboard chipset,lan,sound,graphics, everything,! do not rely on the old drivers
Reinstall the game, follow the instructions

and it will work!

or you can try to download C Cleaner off their site and try to all the junk on your Hard Disk then play again."

,mr.at,2011-11-09T21:22Z,"FUCK ALL ELSE...

ALL THOSE WHOSE GAME IS CRASHING/NOT WORKING...

I found this out after a lot of bullshit. The only proper working crack is the 31.3 MB one (RELOADED). Remember: It's just the .exe file you have to replace. No bullshit patches/cracks/dlls.

Just replace with the right .exe file (31.3 MB), and rename the God damn folder from ""Battlefield 3™"" to only ""Battlefield"".

The game crashes only because of the ™ in the folder name. Some fucked up. Don't know why that is.

Worked for me!"

,sergos_amigos,2012-01-18T08:27Z,Copy the crack from the DVD 2 and delete the small 'tm' from the battlefield 3 installation folder and its working now....thanx dibya.. 
,sergos_amigos,2012-01-18T08:38Z,"""TM"" is not a file. It's just the suffix after ""Battlefield 3"" in folder name. So you just rename the game installation folder by deleting this suffix in name.
It's a small special caracter that game doesn't recognize or it's wrong file name."
