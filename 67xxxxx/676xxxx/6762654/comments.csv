You will be as safe playing this with LT+ as you were in the past with older LT/iXtreme firmwares and non-XGD3 discs, no more no less. But you should burn all XGD3 discs with the proper DVD writers, according to the tutorials, and flashed with the according firmware (to be released within 24 hours from now).

,sam_tauras_1990,2011-10-22T12:18Z,@menexus:this disc uses xgd3 copy protection..the way to defeat it properly is buying a lite on iHAS124B writer or there are total 6 models..u have to flash them with a custom fw..then u can fully burn the game on a dvd..dont worry u will be able to play these games..go to ixtreme.net..they will guide u..just dont talk in terms of piracy there..use the word backups or u will be banned..
,Zenman1976,2011-10-22T12:29Z,"My experience with XGD3 games so far has been to make sure and burn them using CloneCD (I used IMGBURN before but it wont burn XGD3 discs on my LG burner). When asked about overburn select ""write until end of disc""

Additionally, I create any missing .dvd files by simply opening up notepad and typing

LayerBreak=2133520
""filenameofgame"".iso (remove the """")

then saving it as ""filenameofgame"".dvd file (again removing the """")

I'm using LT2 of course and dont really care about getting banned (about ready to buy and flash a slim) but the above offers the most basic overview of burning."

,sam_tauras_1990,2011-10-22T14:13Z,burner means a dvd writer(hardware)..lite-on Ihas124 series to be exact..u will be needing a firmware for that drive which will be released today..the size of these games is 8.7 gb but a dl dvd has only 8.5 gb..so that dvd writer with custom firmware allows 100% game to be written on the cd..some games find out about the missing data like forza 4 which give and error and dont play..i dont know abot bf3 as i have nt dwnloaded it yet..solution to this problem is new dvd writer..GOT IT???

it  was much lower gb. around 7.5gb.
so just like all another older games. so dousent looks like that problem with this game.

its also something to say your age of the xnox.

regarding the forza. meny can only play for some minutes.  some some hours.
and some no problem at all.
i can play it around 10 hours. then i got the error.

only do the is to turn of the xbox and then can play for more hours"

,SimStim,2011-10-22T16:34Z,"@mrnexus

In direct reply to the questions raised. Long story short. You need a compatible DVD burner for ""proper"" (meaning CIV like Forza 4 won't notice anything) XGD3 burning. Consider it an investment of 20-25 bucks, and you'll be ""okay,"" just like before. If you're anyway looking for a new burner, just buy one of the compatible models, they'll do XGD3 as well as anything else a burner usually does.

Flashing of the custom firmware for that burner is straight-forward, if you flashed before, you will have no problems. No need to open your console for this, etc. Really no big deal. Good luck!"
,esc-cos,2011-10-22T17:25Z,"dodsy17

well then you have as i sead a old xbox.
probably one of the first that came out..

have burned just over 200 games. so i feel i have a good referance point.!!


and i have also used imgburn almost on every burn. 

and when isead before about the forza problems. is directed only to the dsk to small issue.  when the file is ti big to burn on a right way. the new imburn, seems to fix this. but not as it should. it burn then ALL  the way to the ends of the disk. new imgburn has this feature.
but as i sead this is not the right way to do it. 

imgburn cant get the burning done to well
and as i wrote before when i talked about the foza,who is  to big to burn proparly on a disk. 

then you get the error. and as i sead,
it  is  different from xbox to xbox.


and not all XGD3 games has this new security.
as for example the forza. 
that the game is to big. 


meybe  you havent burned eny of the ones with the ""disk to smal issue"""

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: BATTLEFIELD 3 - XGP - XBOX360 - REGION FREE {BOOBSMAN}


DISC 1 = Only 4 Online Multiplayer and U will get Banned n U Xbox machine is wasted shit - DONÂ´T DO!

DISC 2 = Singleplayer mode!!


10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated with LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT+1.9 or less)
DASHBOARD: 20135990

DOWNLOAD THE 154 FILES OF THIS 2-DISC GAME. THEN EXTRACKT THE RAR-FILES INTO: 1 ISO GAME FILE, AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE OF THE GAME TO PUT TOGETHER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. 


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3.  Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile (37 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now say: \BATTLEFIELD 3 - XGP - XBOX360 - REGION FREE {BOOBSMAN}  Check write speed 2,4x 

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now ask if U would like to burn the game that is oversized 8.5 GB on u only 8.5 GB disc.
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install the finished burnt 6.7 GB DISC 2 Game to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. It works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""
THAT U CAN ORDER CHEAPEST DVDPACK OF 10, 25, or 50 DISCS = (1 EUR/DISC + mail price) DIFFERENT SIZEPACKS ON: http://www.sweburn.com/search.php?mode=search&page=1

NOTE: (IF) U HAVE OLD FIRMWARE: WHEN U DOWNLOAD ANY NEW GAMES, N U PUT THE DISC IN, IT WILL ASK IF U WANT 2 UPDATE U XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME?

,Lobyone,2011-10-25T20:26Z,there is a BIG difference between installing the HD pack and not.... its practically required
,G3R88,2011-10-26T00:35Z,First I wanna thanks for your help. I try and re-try but I burned 3 dvd 8.5 gb in the way you describe there and still don`t work! I think is the problem of the oversize of the dvd`s. :( Or something else! If you have played this i don`t konw. Maybe i figure out a way! :( 
,aymonnawaz123,2011-10-26T05:30Z,people plz seeed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,aymonnawaz123,2011-10-26T08:01Z,thats the way i burnt 4 games just fine
,MrWalido,2011-10-26T20:47Z,"both discs works 100%
I used Sony DVD+R Dual Layer Disc with my LG burner... No need of Max burner for this game just try to use TDK or Sony DVD+R....
P.S.. i used the latest version of IMGburn"
,MrWalido,2011-10-26T21:49Z,"I dont know why people have so much problems in burning this game..
Just use good quality DVDz such as SonyDVD+R or TDK DVD+R.. 
IMGBurn 2.5.6.0 and choose truncate option..
No need of Ixtreme burner max or liteon drive for this game.."
,Zenman1976,2011-10-27T01:45Z,"@ MrNexus.. yeah I have tried the odd random code (because ya never know) in the past >_< 

One things for sure if you ever see any keygens online for xbox360 games they are not gonna do anything but give your PC an STD ;) 

I got some points to play online.. Glad I did (the MP kicks as much ass as ever) but cant wait for UK servers to be online so I can actually shoot people (laaaaaaaaaaaaag) hehehe.. 

Campaign is very short but second half of SP is off the chain.. 

Many thanks for your efforts Boobdude"

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:23Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."

How can I fit this onto my dual layer dvd when it's 14.59GB and my disc is only 8.5GB?

""overburn"" or ""truncate""
which option should I choose?
Thanks"
