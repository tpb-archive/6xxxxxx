*****RESIDENT EVIL 1*****

GAMEPLAY
The player's character is a member of a special law enforcement task force who is trapped in a mansion populated by dangerous mutated creatures. The objective of the game is to uncover the mystery of the mansion and ultimately escape alive. The game's graphics consist of 3D polygonal characters and objects superimposed over pre-rendered backdrops with pre-determined camera angles. The player controls the character by pushing the d-pad or analog stick left or right to rotate the character and then move the character forward or backwards by the pushing the d-pad up or down.

To fulfill the game's objective, the player uncovers various documents that provide exposition about the game's narrative, as well as clues that help them solve various puzzles within the mansion. Key items are also available that give the player access to other items or new areas. The player can arm their character with weapons to defend themselves from enemies, although the ammunition available for each firearm is limited and the player must learn to conserve the ammunition they have for situations where they will really need it. To restore the character's health, the player uses first-aid sprays or three types of healing herbs that can be mixed together in different combinations for different healing effects. The carrying capacity of the player is limited depending on the character and items that the player does not wish to carry at the moment can be stored into an item box to be retrieved for later use. To save their progress, the player must pick up an ink ribbon and use it on any of the typewriters scattered through key locations in the game. However, the supply of ink ribbons the player can acquire is also limited much like the player's ammo and healing supplies.
The various enemies the player encounters include infected creatures like flesh-eating zombies, zombie dogs, giant spiders, and crows, as well as artificial creatures with codenames such as "Hunters" and "Chimeras", as well as the game's ultimate adversary, a new type of biological weapon known as the "Tyrant".

PLOT:

Setting:
A series of bizarre murders have occurred on the outskirts of Raccoon City, with signs of cannibalism on the victims' remains. The Raccoon Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS) are assigned to investigate the murders. STARS is divided into two teams: Alpha and Bravo. Bravo team is sent first, but after contact with them is lost, Alpha team is sent to investigate their disappearance

Characters:
The player has a choice between Alpha team members Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine as the main character. Chris, the male hero, has greater firepower and can take more damage from enemies, while the heroine Jill has a greater carrying capacity, as well as a lockpicking tool that gives her earlier access to some of the mansion's areas. The game's supporting characters includes Barry Burton, Alpha team's weapons expert who provides Jill with additional firepower; Rebecca Chambers, a surviving member of Bravo team who supports Chris with her medical expertise; and Albert Wesker, the captain of STARS and leader of Alpha team. The other members of STARS also appear through the course of the story dead or alive.

Story:
The game begins on July 24, 1998 after Alpha team locates Bravo team's helicopter, but there are no signs of survivors; only a severed hand is found. While searching the area for further clues, Alpha team is attacked by ferocious dogs, one of which kills one of the team's members, Joseph Frost. Alpha's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone. Pursued by the dogs who killed their colleague, Alpha team is forced to seek refuge within a nearby mansion. It is believed to be abandoned.

With the dogs roaming outside, the four remaining Alpha team members (Albert Wesker, Chris Redfield, Barry Burton and Jill Valentine) are trapped within. A gunshot rings out, and the player character moves to investigate. At this point, the player takes control of the character and begins to explore the mansion. One of the first discoveries is a member of Bravo team, Kenneth J. Sullivan, being eaten by a zombie. The character eventually finds the mansion to be riddled with puzzles, traps, and horrors. Scattered documents suggest that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken on the property by a clandestine research team, under the authority and supervision of the Umbrella Corporation, a biomedical conglomerate. The creatures roaming the mansion and surrounding region are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.

After navigating a series of underground tunnels, passageways and buildings, the player discovers a secret underground laboratory containing the Umbrella Corporation's experiments, including the Tyrant. In the lab, Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella. The player finds himself having to fight the Tyrant T-002, a giant humanoid monster created through prolonged exposure to the T-virus. After the Tyrant is defeated, the player manages to escape the premises in the team helicopter.

*****RESIDENT EVIL 2*****

GAMEPLAY:
Resident Evil 2 follows the same basic gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The graphics are composed of polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds using fixed camera angles. A survival horror title, the game's objective is to explore different locations while solving puzzles and fighting numerous monsters. The two selectable protagonists may be equipped with a variety of firearms, though ammunition is limited, adding a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check the condition of the characters, use medicine to heal wounds inflicted upon them in battle, and assign weapons. Additionally, the current health of the protagonists can be determined by their animation and the speed of their movement. For example, wounded characters will hold their stomach in pain, whereas they will limp slowly when they are on the verge of death. The protagonists can only carry a certain amount of items at a time, requiring the rest to be stored in and retrieved from boxes scattered across the locations. The game may be saved at some select rooms with a typewriter, though one-time-use ink ribbons are necessary to do so
The main addition to the gameplay is the "Zapping System". Each of the two playable characters is confronted with different puzzles and storylines in their respective scenario. After finishing the "A" scenario with one protagonist, a "B" scenario is unlocked in which the events are depicted from the other character's perspective. Actions taken during the first playthrough affect the second scenario, for example in the availability of certain items. After each game, the player receives a ranking based on the total time taken to complete the scenario, and the number of saves and first aid sprays used. Depending on certain requirements, bonus weapons and costumes are unlocked as a reward.[11] Additional minigames are available in the form of "The 4th Survivor", "The To-fu Survivor" and "Extreme Battle", three standalone missions featuring an extended cast of characters.

PLOT:
The game is set in the Midwestern mountain community of Raccoon City, two months after the mansion incident of the first Resident Evil. Nearly all of the citizens have been turned into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Having just arrived in the city, Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris, make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they find out that most of the policemen have been killed already and that Chris has left the town some time ago to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no more motivation to stay, the two protagonists decide to split up to look for other survivors, and to flee from the city.

In search of an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher. Claire discovers that Umbrella bribed Raccoon City's police chief Brian Irons to cover up any evidence of the mansion incident for the purpose of masking the development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of turning a human into the ultimate bioweapon. The maniacal Irons is killed by one such G-virus mutant roaming the police department while Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and are separated from each other. Splitting up from Leon, Ada runs into Sherry and picks up the golden pendant she lost. Further into the sewers, a middle-aged woman fires at Ada, but Leon dives in front of her and takes a shot himself. Ada follows the assassin who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette, and the wife of William Birkin, the creator of the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant, and a battle over it ensues during which she is thrown over a railing. Ada finds out that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.

Meanwhile, Claire reunites with Sherry and discovers that Birkin has already implanted her with an embryo to produce offspring. The protagonists advance through an abandoned factory to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. Ada is heavily wounded by an attack from Birkin, and Leon explores the laboratory to find something to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette explaining to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a smokescreen to get information about Umbrella, and that she is really a spy sent by an unknown organization to retrieve the G-virus. Just as she is about to shoot Leon, a Tyrant monster appears and she is forced to retreat.[20] Ada shows up again and sacrifices herself to rescue Leon, confessing that she fell in love with him. Trying to escape with another sample of the G-virus, Annette is fatally wounded by her mutated husband, but manages to give Claire instructions on how to produce a vaccine for Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, saving her life. Birkin, now mutated into a massive blob, followed them but is eventually destroyed when the self-destruct system causes the train to explode. Ada is implied to have survived and to have made away with the G-virus in the pendant. Having escaped from the city with Sherry, Leon decides to take down Umbrella while Claire continues to search for her brother.

The minigame "The 4th Survivor" depicts the successful G-virus retrieval mission of Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, whereas "The To-fu Survivor" and "Extreme Battle" are completely independent missions that bear no relevance to the plot of the game.

*****RESIDENT EVIL 3*****

PLOT:
The game begins on September 28, 1998. The player takes control of former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS) member Jill Valentine in her attempt to escape a ruined and zombie-infested Raccoon City. On her way to the Raccoon City police station, she runs into Brad Vickers, who is killed by Nemesis for being part of the STARS, since Umbrella believes that the STARS members know about their operations in the Arklay Mountains, and will reveal Umbrella to the world. Later on, she encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef. Nicholai is soon presumed dead after an encounter with zombies as Jill gets parts for the cable car. Mikhail sacrifices himself to save Jill and Carlos from the Nemesis, a bio-organic weapon. The cable car that the three were in bursts into flame and Jill and Carlos are separated.

Jill and Carlos meet up later in a clock tower where Carlos has said a rescue helicopter will arrive. Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the clock tower's bell. Nemesis destroys the helicopter, and infects Jill with a virus. Jill temporarily defeats Nemesis, Carlos finds her in a state of weakness, and she blacks out. During this period, Carlos searches for the vaccine to Jill's infection, and the events of Resident Evil 2 occur.

Carlos goes to Raccoon City Hospital to make the vaccine, and while there, meets Nicholai, who reveals that he is an Umbrella Supervisor who collects information based on the soldiers' ability to fight the BOWs. However, the mercenary that Nicholai shot pulls the pin on a grenade he was holding, and Nicholai jumps out a window to escape the blast. Soon after, Carlos is able to create the vaccine, and as he is leaving to go back to the clock tower, Nicholai sets a time bomb at the base, and blows up the hospital. Carlos returns to Jill with the vaccine, warns her about Nicholai, and leaves. Jill then proceeds through Raccoon Park, where she eventually enters a cabin, finds more about the plans for Raccoon City, and briefly meets up with Nicholai again, who explains the role he played. Leaving, Jill enters the cemetery again, only to face off with a giant worm, and defeat it before proceeding.

Jill meets up with Carlos in an Umbrella facility, who tells her that the US government planned a cover up and the US military, after hearing of unsuccessful efforts to avert the T-virus infestation, ordered the destruction of Raccoon City by a nuclear missile. Jill and Carlos split up again to find a way out of the facility. Jill turns on the power so that an exit can be unlocked, but on the way to it, she meets up with Nicholai. He tells her about how he killed the other Supervisors, and how there is a bounty on Jill's head, but he is killed soon afterward. At this point in the game, the player has fifteen minutes to escape the city before the missile strikes. While attempting to escape, Jill has to face a mutated Nemesis one final time and kill it with the assistance of a rail gun. Jill then escapes Raccoon City along with Carlos. Depending on the player's choices, a different ending plays. The city's destruction by the missile is shown, and depending on the player's actions, Barry Burton is the pilot who saves Jill and Carlos. Then a news report is heard about Raccoon City's destruction, and how people uninvolved will hear about the disaster.

GAMEPLAY:
A new feature to gameplay is the Nemesis, an experimental type of Tyrant programmed by Umbrella to hunt down and kill the remaining STARS members. He can run, use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and is capable of pursuing the player from one area to the next. Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on choices made by the player. Even if defeated in combat, Nemesis will inevitably return to continue pursuit of Jill.

In a departure from series' conventions, the player cannot choose between two playable characters from the beginning. Instead, Jill is the sole selectable character, with another character named Carlos also being controllable for a brief portion of the main game.

Resident Evil 3 incorporates a dodge move that allows the player to quickly avoid enemy attacks. Stair climbing is also streamlined; whereas in previous Resident Evil titles, characters were required to press the action button to ascend or descend a staircase, Resident Evil 3 allows the player to use a staircase by walking directly in to it. The "quick 180 turn" was introduced in this game, and would become a mainstay of the series.

The game also features an ammunition creation system, in which new ammunition can be created from different varieties of gunpowder and the use of a cartridge reloading tool, or by combining gunpowder directly with standard grenade rounds to generate different types of rounds for the grenade launcher. For the first time in the series, explosive objects are present in certain areas. Taking the form of oil drums on the ground, or bundles of an unspecified explosive material affixed to a wall; firing on these objects causes them to explode, damaging or destroying nearby enemies. The game also incorporates a randomization feature that varies the placement of items and enemies. Puzzles are also either completely randomized, or have their solutions selected from a pre-determined list.

At certain points in the game, the player will enter Live Selection Mode, in which they are prompted to choose between one of two possible actions. The choice of action affects the direction of the game and story, including which ending the player receives. Each selection has a time limit, with the consequence for going over the limit being either Jill taking damage, or instant death.

There is an unlockable minigame titled "The Mercenaries - Operation: Mad Jackal". The player can choose from Carlos, Mikhail, or Nicholai; the three UBCS members that appear in the main game. Each character possesses a different inventory, causing drastically different strategies for survival with each character. The objective of the game is ostensibly to run from the cable car to the warehouse office (two locations in the main game), within a limited amount of time; however, the starting time limit given is insufficient to actually perform this task directly, and the player must continuously receive time bonuses by performing certain actions in order to complete the mission. Eliminating enemies yields a time bonus, with increasing bonuses for multiple kills in a short time span. There are also six hostages to be saved, with each hostage saved rewarding the player with additional ammunition or healing items, as well as a time bonus. Additionally, six "hidden areas" of the map reward the player with an increasing time bonus for each one found.

Upon completing the main game, the player is rewarded with a number of alternate costumes for Jill, with more costumes being awarded for a higher ranked completion of the main game. Also unlockable are eight "Epilogue Files" each detailing the activities of a different character following the events of the game. The Epilogue Files are unlocked individually and sequentially at the end of each successful play-through of the main game.
