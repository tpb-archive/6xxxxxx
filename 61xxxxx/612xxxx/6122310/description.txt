Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights is a BAFTA-nominated British sitcom about The Phoenix Club, a working men's club in the northern English town of Bolton, Greater Manchester. The show is written by Neil Fitzmaurice, Peter Kay, Patrick McGuinness and Dave Spikey, produced by Goodnight Vienna Productions and Ovation Entertainments, and was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK. All the music was written by Toni Baker and Peter Kay. Two series have been produced, which were first transmitted in 2001 and 2002.

The show is a spin-off from the spoof documentary series That Peter Kay Thing, and in turn gave rise to the spin-off Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere. It won the People's Choice Award at the British Comedy Awards 2002, and was nominated for several others. Kay is also its star, in multiple roles, and directed the second series. In September 2006, Kay revealed on BBC Radio 1 that a third series of Phoenix Nights has been written, but it is unknown when the series will be filmed. On 8 May 2007, another announcement by Kay was made promising another series will be made.

However Dave Spikey, in interviews with The Sentinel and the Croydon Guardian in late-2009, claimed that neither he nor fellow co-writer Neil Fitzmaurice were aware of any plans to bring back the series as of December 2010, nothing has yet materialised.

But a power cut that leaves the club in the dark, the theft of the bingo machine, a German-speaking arcade machine, Max the doorman injuring himself and a perceived racist folk band, with the lead singer being played by Tim Healy. The band are ostensibly singing about Holy Communion Shoes, although the journalist Deborah detects a racist metaphor. These factors soon ruin everything.

After the meeting, Jerry and Brian rush back to the club before Keith inspects it, but a run in with the police delays them and Keith shuts the club down for being unsafe. Brian, never a quitter, blackmails Lard with a faked photo of his head onto a picture of a semi-nude man with a dog so that he re-opens the club, but the event they re-open for, the psychic night, forces Brian to refund all of his guests after Clinton Baptiste, the psychic (whose appearance and vocal mannerisms parody UK television psychic Derek Acorah), tells a bit more about the future than the guests would like.
