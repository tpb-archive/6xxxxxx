1973 Film - Jory 
 
Jory is a fifteen-year-old boy who joins a horse-drive after his father is killed by a drunkard. The drive's leader and a likable cowhand take the boy under their wing, and find that tragedy has taught him how to take care of himself better than anyone could expect. Jory proves his new found manhood in the finale's thundering stampede and shootout. Written by alfiehitchie.
