Saddle up for laughs and hold on for a hilarious night of down-home humor as rural-minded comics Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy and Ron White come together to crack audiences up in this second follow-up to the 2003 stand up hit Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie. Armed with all-new material and always ready to offer their unique insight into country living, Foxworthy, Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy, and White lay on the jokes for home viewers to enjoy from the best seat in the house. When the show is over, this country comedy quartet heads back to the tour bus to tune up the guitar and offer a hilarious musical ode to all things blue collar.
