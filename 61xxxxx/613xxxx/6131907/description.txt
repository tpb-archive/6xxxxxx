Keyframeable surround panning for tracks and busses lets you mix the most demanding DVD soundtracks without leaving the Vegas environment. Apply 5.1-channel audio effects to the master bus for enhanced control over DVD mixes. Export projects as discrete tracks for post-encoding, or encode directly to Dolby Digital surround with the Sony Media Software Dolby-certified AC-3 encoder.

On-the-fly punch-in recording
The Vegas 6 recording model allows for on-the-fly punch-in recording on armed tracks while playing back your Vegas project. Record and maintain multiple takes of audio into an empty track, a time selection, an event, or a combination of time and events.

Auto-input record monitoring
Perform tape style auto-input record monitoring with event ASR parameters applied to the incoming signal. Monitor input signal when playback is both stopped and during recording.

Audio time stretching
Vegas software includes 19 user-definable timestretch modes that let you choose the resampling method that best fits your audio material. Select: change pitch, change length; change length, preserve pitch; or change pitch and preserve length, by semitones or cents.

Tape-style audio scrubbing
You can use scrubbing to scroll playback of your project at varying speeds. New in Vegas software is a tape-style scrubber above the timeline that mimics dragging an analog tape past the playhead.

ACID loop properties support
Use ACID loops in your Vegas project to perform easy video scoring and audio mixing. ACID loops, or any audio event that has had ACID metadata assigned to it, will auto-stretch to the existing project tempo.

Keyboard event pitch shifting
Pitch change ACID loops, or any audio event that has had ACID metadata assigned to it, via keyboard commands and modify your audio mix in real-time. Pitch, tempo and stretch amount information is displayed in timeline events.

ASIO driver support
In addition to supporting Microsoft Mapper, Windows Classic Wave, and WDM drivers, Vegas software also supports professional-quality low latency ASIO drivers.

Broadcast wave format support
You can use Broadcast wave format files to exchange audio between audio editors or broadcasting platforms. Broadcast wave format files are similar to standard .wav files, but they contain additional metadata including timestamps that tell the software where to add audio on the Vegas timeline.

Film-style 5.1 surround panning
The new film-style surround panning mode in Vegas 6 software supports panning between pairs of adjacent speakers using a constant power model, and is optimized for theater-style speaker placement.

Downmix monitoring
Vegas software provides real-time downmix previewing of audio from 5.1 surround to stereo, or from stereo to mono, to ensure that your mix will sound as intended no matter what the destination playback device.

Bus-to-bus routing
Create complex sub-mixes with bus-to-bus routing. The routing flexibility provided by Vegas software gives you a more robust structure for mixing audio projects.

Master, auxiliary, and effects bus tracks
Modify your project's volume, effects, and panning at the sub-group level. Use bus envelopes to set track effect parameters, volume, and panning for your entire Vegas project.


Optimized workflow
Edit and arrange events on the Vegas timeline using standard Windows drag-and-drop functionality. Use new project nesting to add a Vegas project (.veg) to the timeline and edit and apply effects the same as you would a standard media event. Version 6 also reduces complex project render times on multiprocessor, HT, and multicore systems. Network rendering saves time by using multiple computers and networked drive arrays

Powerful Editing Tools
Efficiently edit and arrange events on the Vegas timeline using drag-and-drop operations. Apply real-time effects, transitions, envelopes, color changes, reverse, time-stretching and motion effects. Expertly edit complex SD or HD long-form projects using mouse or keyboard trimming along with powerful ripple editing modes.

Real-Time Playback/Non-Destructive Editing
Playback and edit video effects, transitions and composites on-the-fly without rendering while viewing each change instantly on external monitors in real-time. Vegas software takes advantage of the PC's processing power by caching complex processes or effects directly to RAM for smooth frame-rate playback and previews.

Project nesting
Nesting allows you to add a Vegas project (.veg) to the timeline and edit and apply effects the same as you would a standard media event. Nesting can also help you organize a timeline or apply other effects.

Split-Screen A/B Previewing
Compare your affected and unaffected video, or compare the timeline with a clipboard image - all viewable in real-time on an external monitor via 1394 enabled hardware.

System-Wide Media Management
You can use the Media Manager window to search and manage your collection of media assets so you can easily find the right file for your Vegas projects. The Media Manager maintains a database of your files, including the attributes, ACID metadata, and tags that you can assign to classify your audio and video clips.

AAF Import and Export
You can use AAF (Advanced Authoring Format) files to exchange projects between applications.

A/V Synchronization Detect and Repair
When audio and video events are not aligned, Vegas software will highlight the events in the timeline so you can see synchronization problems at a glance. The software determines whether source events are synchronized by comparing grouped and overlapping media.

Envelope Automation Recording
Record track envelope and keyframe parameters in real-time using a mouse or external control surface hardware with touch and latch record modes and automatic post-record keyframe thinning. Automation parameter control is available for both stereo and 5.1 tracks and buses, as well as for video track envelopes.

High definition editing and output
Vegas software supports HD editing and rendering, including output to 1080/60i, 1080/30p, 1080/24p, 720/60p, 720/30p, and 720/24p. Output high definition video to .AVI, .MOV, MPEG-2, Windows Media 9 Series, RealVideo 9, .PNG and .JPEG sequences. Work with project sizes up to 2048x2048.

Project references in rendered files
When your Vegas project uses media that was rendered with an embedded project path reference, you can easily open the source project in the associated application if you need to edit the media later. For example, imagine that you have an audio file on the Vegas timeline that was rendered from an ACID project. In previewing your Vegas project, you discover that you accidentally rendered your ACID project with a critical track muted. You can simply right-click the event on the Vegas timeline and choose Edit Source Project from the shortcut menu to reopen your ACID project, unmute the track, and then re-render it.

Trimmer Window
Use the Trimmer window to select portions of a piece of media that can be placed into events on tracks, and easily create media subclips that reference portions of a media file.

JKL Scrub; Timeline and Keyboard Trimming
Scan your project to quickly find edit points using new tape-style scrubbing. Control playback of your project at varying speeds. Scrub using JKL/shuttle, keyboard commands, or external devices such as the Contour A/V Solutions ShuttlePro

Customizable User Interface
Vegas software has a clean and intuitive interface and uses familiar Windows keyboard commands. Windows XP theme support and interface color adjustments allow for a wide variety of customization that best suits your working style.

User Definable Multiple Docking Window Layouts
Design the Vegas editing environment to maximize productivity. Dock multiple windows and save up to ten layout configurations for single and dual monitor systems. Easily recall a customized window layout for a specific editing task, and instantly switch to new layouts during playback.

Customizable Keyboard Mapping
Customize Vegas keyboard commands to fit your editing process. Create and edit new keyboard shortcuts, import a keyboard mapping scheme or save your current layout for use as a backup - even share keyboard layouts with other Vegas users.

Media Subclips
Use the Trimmer window to create subclips that reference portions of a media file. Subclips can also be created directly within the Vegas timeline. All subclips are added to the media pool and can be used like any other event in your Vegas project.

Real-Time A/V Event Reverse
Instantly reverse audio and video events on the timeline either as a locked A/V event group or as independent elements.

Effects Package Folders
Quickly recall frequently used chains of effects in your Vegas project. Effects packages in Vegas 6 software retain their chain order and individual plug-in settings so you can quickly apply desired effects to media.

Additional Marker Support
Vegas software provides support for up to 99 numbered markers. The marker tool allows easy navigation between adjacent markers and editing of multiple selected markers.

Network Rendering
Speed up production time by rendering complex multimedia projects over networked computers. Divide Vegas projects into smaller sections that are distributed across multiple machines, and let Vegas software reassemble the pieces into a single rendered file. Each copy of Vegas software comes with two additional render-only installations.

Keyboard Trimming and Event Shuffling
Expertly edit complex long-form projects using mouse or keyboard trimming, event shuffling, as well as advanced ripple editing modes.

Q: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'
A: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded

Q: 'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.

   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'
A: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum & explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772

Q: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'
A: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701

Q: 'I don't know how to mount an image file. I don't know this I don't know that. How?'
A: Again, drop by to the forum here: http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php & create a new thread under the Help Section
   Alternatively, you can browse through the Tutorials Section first to see if anyone have already answered your question here: http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=43
