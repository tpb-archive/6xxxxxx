Per Wikipedia: \\\"The Elements Trilogy is a trilogy of films by Indian film-maker Deepa Mehta, dealing with controversial issues of social reform on the Indian subcontinent. Fire, the first release in 1996, dealt with issues of arranged marriage and homosexuality in the patriarchal culture of India. Earth, released in 1998, dealt with the religious strife associated with the partition of India and formation of Pakistan in the mid-20th century. Water, released in 2005, was the most critically successful of the three, and dealt with suicide, misogyny, and the mistreatment of widows in rural India... These films are also notable for Mehta\\\'s collaborative work with author Bapsi Sidhwa. Sidhwa\\\'s novel Cracking India, (1991, U.S.; 1992, India; originally published as Ice Candy Man, 1988, England), is the basis for Mehta\\\'s 1998 film, Earth. Mehta\\\'s film, Water, was later published by Sidhwa as the 2006 novel, Water: A Novel.

\\\"Mehta had originally intended to direct Water in February 2000, with the actors Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Akshay Kumar. Her earlier film, Fire, however, had previously attracted hostility from some people in the Hindu community (who objected to her depiction of Hindu culture) and had organized attacks on cinemas that screened that film. Thus, the day before filming of Water was due to begin, the crew was informed that there were complications with gaining location permits. The following day, they learned that 2,000 protesters had stormed the ghats, destroying the main film set, burning and throwing it into the Ganges in protest of the film\\\'s subject matter.

\\\"The resulting tensions meant that Mehta struggled for many years to make Water and was eventually forced to make it in Sri Lanka rather than India. She eventually made the film, with a new cast, and a fake title used during filming (River Moon) in 2003. The struggle to make the film was detailed in a non-fiction book, Shooting Water: A Mother-Daughter Journey and the Making of the Film, written by Mehta\\\'s daughter, author Devyani Saltzman (whose father is Canadian producer and director Paul Saltzman, son of pioneering Canadian weather forecaster Percy Saltzman).

\\\"Critical responses to Mehta\\\'s work surfaced also during the release of Fire in 1998 because members of the Hindu Shiv Sena party felt it was an attack on Hindu tradition and the institution of marriage. Members of the party engaged in mass protests against the film at cinemas in Mumbai and Delhi. After the movie\\\'s release, Mehta spent nearly a year under 24-hour police protection while traveling through North America and Europe. Mehta and others, including feminists who took issue with the film for other reasons, engaged in counter demonstrations to prevent the censorship of the film.\\\"

Also included in this torrent are movie trailers, original soundtracks, and the documentary The Forgotten Woman, directed by Mehta\\\'s brother, which tackles subject matter specific to the film Water.

To check encoding quality, check out the \\\"5-min Fire Sample.avi,\\\" \\\"6-min Earth Sample.avi,\\\" \\\"6-min Water Sample.avi,\\\" and \\\"5-min Forgotten Woman Sample.avi.\\\" Please note, though the samples are without subtitles, English soft subtitle files are included for the four features. Also, please be aware that the production history of these films has been troubled and controversial; as such, limited resources being what they were, the films Fire and Earth were released on DVD as direct transfers with no remastering. That said, video/audio quality of all four features seems quite good, all things considered---just not necessarily the V10/A10 we P2P hounds have gotten used to over the last few years, spoiled brats that we all are.

This is a repack from various other networks, bundled for convenience; thanks to the original encoders and uploaders. Enjoy!
