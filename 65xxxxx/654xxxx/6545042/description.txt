       |  guitar and other fretted instruments.                        |
       |                                                               |

       |  different parameters, configure the outlook of your scores   |

       |  Guitar Pro is also a powerful score player, which            |
       |  facilitates composing or learning a piece.                   |
       |                                                               |
       |  The RSE: realistic audio playback                            |
       |  The RSE (Realistic Sound Engine) technology includes the     |
       |  realistic studio recordings of instruments, as well as some  |
       |  effect modelisations that are the result of years of         |
       |  research.                                                    |
       |  You'll get access to over a hundred soundbanks, and over     |
       |  fifty effects pedals and amps. We provide many presets for   |
       |  all styles, and you can also configure your own effect       |
       |  chains. You can apply a mastering to the final result, with  |
       |  a compressor-limiter, a reverb, and a 10-track equalizer.    |
       |  You can also listen to your scores in MIDI sound.            |
       |                                                               |
       |  Optimized playback options                                   |
       |  During playback, the score automatically scrolls on and a    |
       |  highlighted cursor lets you know which note is being         |
       |  played. You can adjust tempo, and play all or part of a      |
       |  piece in loops. The Speed Trainer will then let you play     |
       |  any section of the score in loops with progressive           |
       |  accelerations. This is very useful to practice a solo or a   |
       |  complex guitar riff!                                         |
       |  All of the effects specific to the guitar (e.g., bend,       |
       |  slide, ghost notes, etc.) are rendered into the playback,    |
       |  as well as the various possible playing styles -             |
       |  pickstroking, fingerpicking or slapping, for instance.       |
       |                                                               |
       |  Tools                                                        |
       |  Guitar Pro is a true workshop for guitarists: chord and      |
       |  scale libraries, tuner, metronom, virtual fretboard and      |
       |  keyboard.                                                    |
       |  All of those tools work with fretted instruments from 4 to   |
       |  8 strings.                                                   |
       |                                                               |
       |  Diagram generator                                            |
       |  Request any chord in any tuning, and Guitar pro will         |
       |  display all possible finger positions for you. Draw a        |
       |  diagram by clicking on the grid, and Guitar Pro will         |
       |  suggest all possible names for that chord.                   |
       |                                                               |
       |  Scale engine                                                 |
       |  The scale engine presents a large directory of scales, from  |
       |  the most common to the most exotic, for you to look at and   |
       |  listen to. Whichever scale you select can be shown on the    |
       |  fretboard or keyboard to work as support for you to write    |
       |  your score. The search function also allows you to quickly   |
       |  find out what scale is being used in all or part of the      |
       |  score.                                                       |
       |                                                               |
       |  MIDI and digital tuners                                      |
       |  The digital tuner allows you to tune your guitar by          |
       |  plugging it into the soundcard, or via a microphone. You     |
       |  can also simply tune your guitar by ear, string by string,   |
       |  with the MIDI tuner.                                         |
       |  Those work for all possible tunings.                         |
       |                                                               |
       |  Virtual fretboard and keyboard                               |
       |  The virtual fretboard and keyboard are here to help you see  |
       |  the notes from the score, or capture them into it. They can  |
       |  show you the notes of the current beat, as well as the       |
       |  notes of the next beat, of the whole bar or yet again of     |
       |  the scale you have selected. Those are indispensable tools   |
       |  if you are beginning or is you wish to capture notes with    |
       |  the mouse.                                                   |
       |                                                               |

       |  Since the Guitar Pro format has become a true standard on    |
       |  the Internet, the software will let you enjoy thousands of   |
       |  scores that are already available over many websites (files  |
       |  in *.gp3, *.gp4, *.gp5 and *.gpx formats)                    |
