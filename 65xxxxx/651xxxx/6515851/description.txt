Batman: A Death in the Family

Batman readers were allowed to vote on the outcome of the story and they decided 
that Robin should die! As the second person to assume the role of Batman's sidekick,
Jason Todd had a completely different personality than the original Robin. Rash and 
prone to ignore Batman's instructions, Jason was always quick to act without regard 
to consequences. In this fatal instance, Robin ignores his mentor's warnings when he 
attempts to take on the Joker by himself and pays the ultimate price. Driven by anger
with Superman by his side, Batman seeks his vengeance as he looks to end the Joker's 
threat forever.
