An inbound firewall prevents Internet attacks such as hackers from coming into your computer. Any suspicious or unauthorized communications are filtered by the firewall. However, if these threats get through your firewall your personal data could then be transmitted back out to the hacker. To catch these thieves on their way out your firewall must be capable of automatically blocking unauthorized outbound communications - â€œoutbound protectionâ€.

Some firewalls donâ€™t have whatâ€™s called â€œoutbound protectionâ€. That means they canâ€™t control information that leaves your computer. This is risky, since hackers have ways around inbound firewalls. The ZoneAlarm outbound protection references our constantly updated database of trusted programs and program behaviorâ€”so the ZoneAlarm firewall can make security decisions safely and automatically.
