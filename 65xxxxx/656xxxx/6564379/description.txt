A USA Today bestseller, Lois has received several national kudos including featured alternate in Doubleday and Rhapsody book clubs, and featured selection in romantic suspense in Mystery Guild book club. Her awards include Holt, Laurel Wreath, RIO (Reviewers International Organization), Bookseller's Best, WRWA Reader's Award for Single Title, B.Dalton's Bestseller Award, several RT nominations and awards, including Reviewer's Choice Award. However, she lists her top achievement as several years as a single mother of her three daughters, while she worked a full-time day job and wrote for two publishers. Lois lives in Missouri with her three daughters, she says that three is her lucky number, because she was born in a three year, married in one, and she has three lovely daugthers. She loves computers, the Internet, creating bookmarks and newsletters, and reading everything, and she attends museums, festivals, powwows, and other rendezvous for research. Lois also enjoys raising herbs and scented geraniums, driving cross-country, photography, cooking, and generally experiencing life. On her list of future experiences are updating her ballroom, Latin American, and folk dancing, and travelling abroad (and having Robert Duvall as a tango teacher).
