* PLOT :


* In 1873 Arizona, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) awakens with no memory and a strange metal bracelet strapped to his wrist, and perhaps an even stranger wound. He enters the small town of Absolution, where the local preacher, Meacham, stitches up his wound before he quickly subdues Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), who has been terrorizing the populace. The sheriff recognizes the stranger as Jake Lonergan, a wanted outlaw, and tries to arrest him. Jake nearly escapes, but a mysterious woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out.
 
Percy\'s father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), a rich and influential cattleman, arrives with his men and demands that Percy be released to him. He also wants Jake, who stole Dolarhyde\'s gold. During the standoff, alien spaceships begin attacking the town, and Percy, the sheriff, and many townsfolk are abducted. Jake shoots down one ship with a device concealed in his bracelet, ending the attack.
 
Dolarhyde, Ella, and some townsfolk form a posse to track an alien, that may have ejected from the downed ship. Jake, meanwhile, travels to an abandoned cabin, and in a flashback, recalls bringing his wife the stolen gold just before both were abducted by the aliens. Jake returns to join the posse. During the night, the alien they were tracking appears and kills the preacher.
 
By the next morning, most of the posse has deserted, and the others are attacked by Jake\'s former gang. Jake, who stole the gang\'s loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control, but fails. As he and the others flee, the aliens begin attacking again and Ella is seized. Jake jumps aboard the ship and kills the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash, but Ella has been mortally wounded .
