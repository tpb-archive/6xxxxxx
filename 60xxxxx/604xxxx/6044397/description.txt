My Kinda Party is the title of the fourth studio album released by American country music artist Jason Aldean. It was released on November 2, 2010 on Broken Bow Records.

Aldean said that he chose the name of the album because he thought it was representative of "what my fans have come to expect." He also said that it has a unique sound because he recorded it with his touring band and an engineer who does not work with any other artists.

The first single from My Kinda Party is the title track, which debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at #41. The song has become Aldean's tenth Top 10 hit on that chart. The song also debuted at #54 on the Hot 100 chart. "My Kinda Party" was written and originally recorded by southern rock singer-songwriter Brantley Gilbert for his 2009 album Modern Day Prodigal Son.

The album also includes a duet with Kelly Clarkson called "Don't You Wanna Stay", which debuted on the country charts from unsolicited airplay at #59 for the week of November 20, 2010. The song also debuted at #93 on the Hot 100 chart. Aldean and Clarkson performed this song at the 44th Annual CMA Awards on November 10, 2010.

This album also contains the country rap-themed "Dirt Road Anthem", which was previously recorded separately by both of its writers, Brantley Gilbert and Colt Ford. According to The Boot, Aldean's publicist teased about this song, suggesting Aldean listened to "a little Snoop Dogg in his time"; regarding the song, Aldean said that he did not consider "Dirt Road Anthem" a rap song.
