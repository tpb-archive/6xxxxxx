open terminal.
type

,kcmorgain,2011-02-26T19:57Z,"Don't know how to do the Activation Blocker. When I open the terminal application I did not find any text that said 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255  broadcasthost. When I attempt to paste the info provided it does not let me paste everything. It stops at the finale adobe without .com part. 
Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,kcmorgain,2011-02-26T23:39Z,"Let me be more specific about the problem. We opened terminal app and did the login root thing and the password. We then pasted the  sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts sentence, as specified. I pressed enter. Correct? Or not. That's not specified. What happened then was a host file came up with a couple lines exactly as was mentioned about the 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255 
    broadcasthost. I copied the stuff to paste between those two lines. When I went to paste it it wouldn't accept the paste. You can type in the file by hand, but, you can't paste anything there. I tried copying from the host file back into the initial terminal app file and nothing could be copied. The host file info would not copy. What am I missing? I feel like we're almost there.

I first copied the text, then in the file that had the localhost and broadcasthost info did command+shift+t and a message came up saying ""localhost is used to configure the loopback interface when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. I went on to paste anyway and nothing happened. Next I copied the text, then did the command+shift+t in the Terminal app, then I pasted. I had the same problem of not being able to paste all the text that was pasted. Do you have any other suggestions. Am I doing something wrong?                                        "
,kcmorgain,2011-03-03T17:36Z,I just realized your instructions are to do the command+shift+t in file I am copying. I just did that it asked if I wanted to change to plain text. I answered yes then tried to paste into the host file and the Terminal app and still no luck.

,Piloted,2011-03-09T17:31Z,"Fantastic. Thank you. However I do have one small problem which may have been caused by me.

When I type ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts""

Any ideas?"

Thank's, comments like yours makes me wanna upload more stuff! :))

I wasn't sure what to do with the sudo host because the second time I went to do it with dreamweaver it still had what I had done for photoshop so I did not mess with it and figured it would work for dreamweaver as well if I just entered a code. Now I must enter serials everytime I open. I would really appreciate some advice if you have any because this is kinda out of my price range lol

,idknuthin,2011-05-23T05:26Z,"Hey Cyberpiraten

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it and then pasted the codes into the host again.

Download a free program called 'Little Snitch'. Don't worry about the hosts file, you won't need to change it in the way noted in the torrent. Make sure Little Snitch is running. Install Dreamweaver as normal, when prompted for a serial during installation enter one of those provided with the torrent. Let it install, and run the program. (don't fart around with hosts...)

Little Snitch will then report that the software is trying to access adobe's activation servers. click 'forever' and 'deny'. Enjoy."

3. Start Dreamweaver Installation.
4. Select full version and use CD keys suggest in the  torrent.
5. During installation the DW would like to connect to the Internet. Please DENY FOREVER all the connections using the Little Snitch.

I owe you so much for all the help you have provided. I would not have one tenth the skills without your help and uploads. I never would have been able to become expert at P'shop, Dreamweaver and other skills without your generous and amazing spirit. I myself am a rather inventive and benevolent outlaw in certain areas of exsistence and I applaud your courage in thinking and acting differently than most. You are the best Brother and I very much appreciate all you accomplish for others. Live long and healthy and happy my friend!"
