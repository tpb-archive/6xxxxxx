Another Alarmist film about the fact that one of the numerous types of the earth's resources is actually finite and one day will run out. The fact remains that long before it happens the market will force a new solution by necessity and until then its no use stressing out about it. Save petrol and do not use a car to travel to hire this DVD.

Seriously it is a great crisis and oil prices are already exponentially rising.

Peak Oil is being reached very rapidly.

The question is will humanity learn to use energy more efficiently and curb overpopulation with contraception and the answer is no.

The Human race is unfortunately doomed to a crisis caused by overpopulation and depleted resources.
