,Anyok6,2010-12-15T03:19Z,"I realized an error in the read-me, at step 1.
Please follow the step 1 as follows.


1. Install Sims 3

*** EDITED HERE ***
*** PLEASE READ ***

I had realized that the instructions I provided are not 100% correct. 
Be sure to download this update from the Sims Wiki patch-archive.

http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe

        Update to 1.15.xxx   (NOT 1.18.xxx as initially indicated)"
,Anyok6,2010-12-15T04:25Z,"I found another error in the package. Please read the revised step below.

6. Install FastLane
	Update Ambitions and then FastLanes

*** EDITED HERE ***
*** PLEASE READ ***

        The update provided in the torrent for FastLanes is the wrong patch.
Follow the link provided to apply the propper patch.

http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/Sims3_5.4.4.009001_from_5.0.44.008001.exe

Following this step, update the Base Game to 1.18, from its current 1.15.
If you do not update, you will not be able to install Late Night."

,Rick050989,2010-12-20T14:14Z,"Ok, I got all installed and it works. But after a few mins when I'm in the game world, the game crashes? Any ideas how to fix that?"
,Anyok6,2010-12-20T23:41Z,"No, I have no idea.
Like I said, this is what worked for me after literally two weeks of trying to get the sims 3 + all expansions.
I did have the game crash when I put one of the two houses I downloaded in, so if you did that, that may be why. Otherwise, no idea. Sorry!


Seed Please!"
,womaan,2010-12-21T02:59Z,que casa da problemas?
,simonev,2010-12-22T17:39Z,"Thank you very much for this upload, sadly enough I'm getting some problems. I first installed the whole package through the old instructions, and it didn't work. I kept getting a black screen when I started up sims 3 through the crack. The black screen went back to my desktop, and it never started sims 3. 
Then I saw your additions to these old instructions, so I removed the whole bunch; uninstalled it, and installed the whole bunch again. Still I have the same issues. I even removed late night en found a crack for world adventures, but that didn't work also.
Can you think of a solution?"
,Anyok6,2010-12-23T01:53Z,"When it loads up, and turns black, alt tab. There may be a gray window that says that you have an unofficial mod installed, cancel or continue. Hit continue and the game will work.
I have test this on 4 PCs, 2 did not have this happen and 2 did. It would go black and seem like the game wasn't playing but when I alt-tabbed, I found a window and hit continue, and it worked like new. I believe this is due to the Late Night crack. Either way, let me know if that seems to solve your issue! "

,Rick050989,2010-12-23T09:57Z,"When the game crashes, it completely closes. It doesn't go black or anything, it just closes. Never have the option for choosing cancel or continue due to onofficial version. Kinda disappointing. I'm uninstalling all now. Hope I find anything else that does work :(."

Thanks again, Anyok6!!"

,aphox,2011-01-01T19:03Z,"I was having trouble with the game silently dropping to desktop after getting to Live mode. I kept reinstalling, going to an earlier expansion and cracking that one. Still the same, a few seconds after switching to Live mode.

So, I finally did the thing I should have done in the first place and Googled the problem. Turns out I had to opt-out the executables with DEP since I'm using 64-bit 7. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now, could have saved myself a few hours."

I download and installed everything using the S# of the ""instructions"" file. But then, when I tried to move the cracks, there are just to apps that generate serial numbers. How do I get a crackfile to substitute the TSE3 of Late Night? 

Everytime I open any of the Sims3 they run perfectly until the neighbohood screem appears, something says that Sims cannot authenticate my version and I closes Sims3 (probably because I'm still no using the creack)

What do I do? Just move the 2apps to Late Night? generate a S# and copypaste it where? I'm so close to play it :("

,chrisbobis,2011-02-06T00:00Z,"Followed the instructions to the letter, got a ""service initialization failed (0x024e424f)"" on launch.

I should have expected errors when after applying the patch it told you the patch was not installed properly. 

Waste of 3 days of download time. Waste of 3 hours of install time. I guess I wont be making my Sims 3 return nor do I intend on it, with installations and patching this confusing and buggy.

and then, instead of cracking late night at the end of this torrent, can I install and update outdoor living stuff and crack that?

i don't torrent often so i'm just double checking"

I would not have archived all of the files, becasue then people could just dl the cracks they needed.  I appreciate your efforts though."
,cupcakeosaur,2011-02-07T06:59Z,"I'm having trouble getting the game to run. When I go to update Late Night, it says there was a problem that interrupted the install wizard, so it wasn't able to update completely. Is anyone else having this problem?"
,cupcakeosaur,2011-02-07T07:05Z,"Okay so my problem was with Fast Lane Stuff, not LAte Night. Can I just delete that file and try reinstalling, or maybe just delete it and play with out it?"

,danypoa,2011-02-10T14:27Z,"@cupcakeosar I don't really understand what you are talking about... you had a problem updating in Fast Lane and now you want to delete the update file? Or do you want to uninstall the Fast Lane collection? If you do the first, the game will not work... you have to follow every step. A few comments back I left a link for more detailed instructions, take a look."

,Krukester,2011-04-11T16:31Z,"*sighs* Follow THE INSTRUCTIONS (the ones on this website) and everything will install fine. 

Extract the main file using WINRAR. Then mount the original sims game using Dameon Tools and follow the instructions from there on out. Do NOT install the EA Downloader thing, cause it may auto-update your game. Just keep double checking the instructions to make sure your updating when it needs to be updated. The keygen is RIGHT IN THE TORRENT, so you don't need to go looking for serials. The No-CD crack is also in the torrent (same file was the keygen). I installed the game without a hitch, then when I ran it, it said something about ""non-official use, may cause bugs"". I think it's supposed to say this. The game started for me, but it was late so I didn't play. I'll play it today and let you know if it works bug free or not :)

I had originally downloaded Sims 3 + World Adventures before (diff torrent) and WA got bugged after awhile and would glitch out (making the game unplayable)."

Second: To install this torrent correctly you must follow the instructions! I had 2 unconviniences that made me lose some time so i want to specify them for u guys.

-Download the 2 patches that are written on the instructions after you DL the torrent.

-When i was installing the world adventures, it asked me for the first cd so i just click it and the installing program shut down, anyway, after re instaling it worked perfectly.

-Some random program called ""origin"" tried to get installed on my pc, i didnt let it... im not sure what it was so i didnt installed and i can play the game perfectly so, is not necesary.

-after doing all the instalation procces and trying to play, the game went off and showed an inbox that said pretty much ""this is not a legal version blah blah""... just press continue and thats it =)!

Well im not sure if that helps in some way but, any how i want to thank Anyok6 and have my word ill be seeding for a while!

P.S. WORKS 100%! just follow instructions and enjoy"
