Dark Shadows the complete episodes (part 1 of 5)

DVD-Rips

encoded as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC with HandBrake. The complete Dark Shadows released in five parts totaling 129Gbs. Including all bonus interviews from the DVD's. The order of the torrents follows the DVDs starting in this torrent with the introduction of Barnabas Collins and running in sequence to the end. The fifth and final part will be "the Beginning" collection, pre-Barnabas. This torrent collects DVD sets 1-7.

I have kept the original episode titles from the DVDs. I did not rename the episodes with their original episode numbers. The number ending the title string denotes the episode order (1-11, 11 being the bonus interview) As far as I can tell the quality is some of the best of the DS torrents out there, it was made using HandBrake's "high Profile" feature H.264 Video Codec/MPEG-4 Container

It has been brought to my attention that episode 3 from set 4 disk 3 is only seven minutes long. I have re uped that episode as its own torrent 

Throughout this collection five bonus interviews width's were slightly cropped by accident. This results in occasional cutting off of the intervieweeâ€™s name, not a huge deal. IT DOES NOT HOWEVER AFFECT THE ACTUAL EPISODES.
