The Infinite Monkey Cage
Broadcast on BBC Radio 4
Monday 30 November to 20 December 2009 16:30-16:55

Physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince take a witty, irreverent and unashamedly rational look at the world through scientists' eyes.

Each week Brian and Robin will be joined by top scientists and some well-known science fans to talk about their view of the world â€“ what has annoyed them; what has excited them; and why scientific reasoning can help in some of the most unlikely situations.

From the news agenda, to culture and politics, Brian, Robin and guests will be tackling life, the universe and everything, starting with the biggest question of all â€“ what on Earth the title of the programme means!

Part 1 - Ex-cosmologist Dara O'Briain discusses why science seems to be such a fertile breeding ground for life as a comedian; Robin visits the archives of one of his all-time science heroes; and Brian tackles his personal mission to put science back at the heart of the political agenda.

Part 2 - Robin and Brian are joined by alien abduction expert Jon Ronson and Seth Shostack from the SETI Institute in California to discuss science conspiracies, UFOs and the search for ET.

Part 3 - Physicist turned comedian Ben Miller and science writer Philip Ball join Brian and Robin to discuss quantum physics, and if astrology really shares its roots with more scientific pursuits. They also discuss the largest scientific experiment ever undertaken, currently storming ahead in a large underground tunnel just outside Geneva.

Part 4 - Robin and Brian are joined by Victor Stock, Dean of Guildford Cathedral, and science journalist Adam Rutherford for a special Christmas edition of the programme. Adam explains why religion really could be good for your health, and can Victor convert Robin and Brian in time for the festive season?

The Infinite Monkey Cage - Series 2
Broadcast on BBC Radio 4
Monday 14 June to 5 July 2010 16:30-17:00

Physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince return for a new series of BBC Radio 4's witty, irreverent and unashamedly rational look at the world according to science.

Part 1 - In a special programme recorded as part of this year's Cheltenham Science Festival, Brian and Robin are joined by special guests Ben Miller and Robert Winston to explore the choppy waters of science and fame. Are we are entering a golden age of science popularity? Is there a genuine interest in the wonder of science and is science the real star or is it simply being dumbed down as a result of our celebrity obsessed culture?

They'll be asking whether science needs to be popular and whether this new wave of enthusiasm has any real impact on science policy, or the quality of science being done in this country. Has science finally found the S Factor?

Part 2 - Trust me I'm a Scientist: Brian and Robin are joined by special guests Ben Goldacre and comedian Dave Gorman to discuss the notion of trust in science. Why are people prepared to believe in magic and pseudoscience rather than empirical evidence, and does it matter?

Science often appears open ended and evolving, a reason to mistrust it, especially when it can feel like we are bombarded with so much contradictory information. So is the scientific method the only way to truly test if something works, and why should we trust the scientists over alternative practitioners who many people would argue have helped them more than anything that comes out of a laboratory.

Part 3 - Special guests Jonathan Ross, graphic novelist Alan Moore and string theorist Brian Greene, join Brian Cox and Robin Ince on stage for a special edition of the science show that boldly goes where no other science show has been before. In a special science fiction themed programme, recorded in front of an audience at London's Southbank Centre, Brian, Robin and guests discuss multiple dimensions, alternate universes and look at whether science fact is far more outrageous than anything Hollywood or science fiction authors could ever come up with.

Part 4 - Things Can Only Get Better? In the last of the current series, physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince look at the notion of perfection and whether the latest advances in the biomedical sciences could ever lead us to the perfect body. What are the limitations of science, and can we visualise a future where we transcend the human form that evolution has led us to, and would we want to?

Monday 15 November 2010 16:30-17:00

Physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince return for the third series of the witty, irreverent science show.

Part 1 of 4 - Apocalypse!
Brian and Robin are joined by comedian Andy Hamilton to discuss some of the wackier apocalyptic theories, as well as those more grounded in science fact. Did the Mayans know something that we didn't with their prediction of global annihilation in 2012, or should we be focusing our energies and scientific know-how on some of the more likely scenarios, from near earth asteroids, through to climate change and deadly pandemics, or even the more long term possibilities of our sun burning out....although we have got roughly another 5 billion years to ponder the challenge of that problem. Recorded in front of an audience at the Drill Hall in London.

Physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince are joined by the Australian comedian and musician Tim Minchin and mathematician Alex Bellos to discuss randomness, probability and chance.
